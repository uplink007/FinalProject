VA (0, 1)-matrix is an integer matrix in which each element is a 0 or 1. It is also called a logical matrix, binary matrix, relation matrix, or Boolean matrix. The number of m×n binary matrices is 2^(mn), so the number of square n×n binary matrices is 2^(n^2) which, for n = 1, 2, ..., gives 2, 16, 512, 65536, 33554432, ... (OEIS A002416).

aVThe 120-cell is a finite regular four-dimensional polytope with Schläfli symbol {5, 3, 3}. It is also known as the hyperdodecahedron or hecatonicosachoron, and is composed of 120 dodecahedra, with 3 to an edge, and 720 pentagons. The 120-cell has 600 vertices and 1200 edges. It is one of the six regular polychora.\u000aIn the plate following p. 176, Coxeter illustrates the polytope.\u000aThe dual of the 120-cell is the 600-cell.\u000aThe vertices of the 120-cell with circumradius 2sqrt(2) and edge length 3 - sqrt(5) are given by the following sets, where \u03d5 is the golden ratio.

aVThe "15 puzzle" is a sliding square puzzle commonly (but incorrectly) attributed to Sam Loyd. However, research by Slocum and Sonneveld has revealed that Sam Loyd did not invent the 15 puzzle and had nothing to do with promoting or popularizing it. The puzzle craze that was created by the 15 puzzle began in January 1880 in the United States and in April in Europe and ended by July 1880. Loyd first claimed in 1891 that he invented the puzzle, and he continued until his death a 20 year campaign to falsely take credit for the puzzle. The actual inventor was Noyes Chapman, the Postmaster of Canastota, New York, and he applied for a patent in March 1880.

aVTake any positive integer of two digits or more, reverse the digits, and add to the original number. Does iterating this procedure, known as the 196-algorithm, starting with the number 196 eventually produce a palindromic number?
p4
aVThe 57-cell, also called the pentacontaheptachoron, is a regular self-dual locally projective polytope with 57 hemidodecahedral facets described by Coxeter and also constructed by Vanden Cruyce. It has 57 vertices, 171 edges, 171 faces, and 57 cells. It cannot be represented in 3-dimensional space in any reasonable way and is highly self-intersecting even in 4-dimensional space because its boundary cells are single-sided manifolds such as a Möbius strip or Klein bottle. Its symmetry group is the projective special linear group L_2(19), of order 3420.\u000aThe skeleton of the 57-cell is the Perkel graph.
p5
aVThe 600-cell is the finite regular four-dimensional polytope with Schläfli symbol {3, 3, 5}. It is also known as the hypericosahedron or hexacosichoron. It is composed of 600 tetrahedra, with 5 to an edge. The 600-cell has 120 vertices and 720 edges. It is one of the six regular polychora.\u000aIn the plate following p. 160, Coxeter gives two illustrations of the polytope.\u000aThe dual of the 600-cell is the 120-cell.\u000aThe vertices of the 600-cell with circumradius 2 and edge length 2/\u03d5, where \u03d5 is the golden ratio, are given by the following sets.

aVThe coordinate system obtained by inversion of Cartesian coordinates, with u, v, w element (-\u221e, \u221e). The transformation equations are\u000ax | = | u/(u^2 + v^2 + w^2)\u000ay | = | v/(u^2 + v^2 + w^2)\u000az | = | w/(u^2 + v^2 + w^2).
p7
aVA mechanical counting device consisting of a frame holding a series of parallel rods on each of which beads are strung. Each bead represents a counting unit, and each rod a place value. The primary purpose of the abacus is not to perform actual computations, but to provide a quick means of storing numbers during a calculation. Abaci were used by the Japanese and Chinese, as well as the Romans.
p8
aVAn Abelian group is a group for which the elements commute (i.e., AB = BA for all elements A and B). Abelian groups therefore correspond to groups with symmetric multiplication tables.\u000aAll cyclic groups are Abelian, but an Abelian group is not necessarily cyclic. All subgroups of an Abelian group are normal. In an Abelian group, each element is in a conjugacy class by itself, and the character table involves powers of a single element known as a group generator.\u000aIn the Wolfram Language, the function AbelianGroup[{n1, n2, ...}] represents the direct product of the cyclic groups of degrees n_1, n_2, ....

aVThe absolute value of a real number x is denoted left bracketing bar x right bracketing bar and defined as the "unsigned" portion of x, left bracketing bar x right bracketing bar | = | xsgn(x)\u000a | = | {-x | for x<=0\u000ax | for x>=0, auto right match \u000awhere sgn(x) is the sign function. The absolute value is therefore always greater than or equal to 0. The absolute value of x for real x is plotted above.

aVLet a particle travel a distance s(t) as a function of time t (here, s can be thought of as the arc length of the curve traced out by the particle). The speed (the scalar norm of the vector velocity) is then given by\u000a(ds)/(dt) = sqrt(((dx)/(dt))^2 + ((dy)/(dt))^2 + ((dz)/(dt))^2).
p11
aVAn accumulation point is a point which is the limit of a sequence, also called a limit point. For some maps, periodic orbits give way to chaotic ones beyond a point known as the accumulation point.
p12
aVThe Ackermann function is the simplest example of a well-defined total function which is computable but not primitive recursive, providing a counterexample to the belief in the early 1900s that every computable function was also primitive recursive. It grows faster than an exponential function, or even a multiple exponential function.
p13
aVLet M(X) denote the group of all invertible maps X->X and let G be any group. A homomorphism \u03b8:G->M(X) is called an action of G on X. Therefore, \u03b8 satisfies \u000a1. For each g element G, \u03b8(g) is a map X->X:x\u21a6\u03b8(g) x. \u000a2.\u03b8(gh) x = \u03b8(g)(\u03b8(h) x). \u000a3.\u03b8(e) x = x, where e is the group identity in G. \u000a4.\u03b8(g^(-1)) x = \u03b8(g)^(-1) x.

aVActuarial science is the study of risk through the use of mathematics, probability, and statistics. A person who performs risk assessment is known as an actuary. Actuaries typically are employed in financial, insurance, pensions, and other related sectors.\u000aActuarial science is similar to medicine in that a lot of time must be taken for schooling and taking examinations, but salaries are typically rather high.\u000aThe Season 1 episode "Sacrifice" of the television crime drama NUMB3RS mentions actuarial science.
p15
aVAn angle of less than \u03c0/2 radians (90°) is called an acute angle.
p16
aVA triangle in which all three angles are acute angles. A triangle which is neither acute nor a right triangle (i.e., it has an obtuse angle) is called an obtuse triangle. From the law of cosines, for a triangle with side lengths a, b, and c, cosC = (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)/(2ab), with C the angle opposite side C. For an angle to be acute, cosC>0. Therefore, an acute triangle satisfies a^2 + b^2>c^2, b^2 + c^2>a^2, and c^2 + a^2>b^2.\u000aThe smallest number of acute triangles into which an arbitrary obtuse triangle can be dissected is seven if B>90°, B - A, B - C<90°, and otherwise eight. A square can be dissected into as few as 9 acute triangles.
p17
aVAn acyclic digraph is a directed graph containing no directed cycles, also known as a directed acyclic graph or a "DAG." Every finite acyclic digraph has at least one node of outdegree 0. The numbers of acyclic digraphs on n = 1, 2, ... vertices are 1, 2, 6, 31, 302, 5984, ... (OEIS A003087).\u000aThe numbers of labeled acyclic digraphs on n = 1, 2, ... nodes are 1, 3, 25, 543, 29281, ... (OEIS A003024). Weisstein's conjecture proposed that positive eigenvalued (0, 1)-matrices were in one-to-one correspondence with labeled acyclic digraphs on n nodes, and this was subsequently proved by McKay et al. (2004).
p18
aVGiven a triangle \u0394ABC, construct the contact triangle \u0394T_A T_B T_C. Now extend lines parallel to the sides of the contact triangle from the Gergonne point. These intersect the triangle \u0394ABC in the six points P, Q, R, S, T, and U. C. Adams proved in 1843 that these points are concyclic in a circle now known as the Adams' circle.
p19
aVThe combining of two or more quantities using the plus operator. The individual numbers being combined are called addends, and the total is called the sum. The first of several addends, or "the one to which the others are added, " is sometimes called the augend. The opposite of addition is subtraction.\u000aWhile the usual form of adding two n-digit integers (which consists of summing over the columns right to left and "carrying" a 1 to the next column if the sum exceeds 9) requires n operations (plus carries), two n-digit integers can be added in about 2lgn steps by n processors using carry-lookahead addition. Here, lgx is the lg function, the logarithm to the base 2.
p20
aVThe adjacency matrix, sometimes also called the connection matrix, of a simple labeled graph is a matrix with rows and columns labeled by graph vertices, with a 1 or 0 in position (v_i, v_j) according to whether v_i and v_j are adjacent or not. For a simple graph with no self-loops, the adjacency matrix must have 0s on the diagonal. For an undirected graph, the adjacency matrix is symmetric.\u000aThe illustration above shows adjacency matrices for particular labelings of the claw graph, cycle graph C_4, and complete graph K_4.
p21
aVAn affine transformation is any transformation that preserves collinearity (i.e., all points lying on a line initially still lie on a line after transformation) and ratios of distances (e.g., the midpoint of a line segment remains the midpoint after transformation). In this sense, affine indicates a special class of projective transformations that do not move any objects from the affine space R^3 to the plane at infinity or conversely. An affine transformation is also called an affinity.\u000aGeometric contraction, expansion, dilation, reflection, rotation, shear, similarity transformations, spiral similarities, and translation are all affine transformations, as are their combinations. In general, an affine transformation is a composition of rotations, translations, dilations, and shears.
p22
aVThere are four varieties of Airy functions: Ai(z), Bi(z), Gi(z), and Hi(z). Of these, Ai(z) and Bi(z) are by far the most common, with Gi(z) and Hi(z) being encountered much less frequently. Airy functions commonly appear in physics, especially in optics, quantum mechanics, electromagnetics, and radiative transfer.\u000aAi(z) and Bi(z) are entire functions.\u000aA generalization of the Airy function was constructed by Hardy.\u000aThe Airy function Ai(x) and Bi(x) functions are plotted above along the real axis.
p23
aVThe Alexander polynomial is a knot invariant discovered in 1923 by J. W. Alexander. The Alexander polynomial remained the only known knot polynomial until the Jones polynomial was discovered in 1984. Unlike the Alexander polynomial, the more powerful Jones polynomial does, in most cases, distinguish handedness.\u000aIn technical language, the Alexander polynomial arises from the homology of the infinitely cyclic cover of a knot complement. Any generator of a principal Alexander ideal is called an Alexander polynomial. Because the Alexander invariant of a tame knot in S^3 has a square presentation matrix, its Alexander ideal is principal and it has an Alexander polynomial denoted \u0394(t).
p24
aVThe above topological structure, composed of a countable union of compact sets, is called Alexander's horned sphere. It is homeomorphic with the ball B^3, and its boundary is therefore a sphere. It is therefore an example of a wild embedding in E^3. The outer complement of the solid is not simply connected, and its fundamental group is not finitely generated. Furthermore, the set of nonlocally flat ("bad") points of Alexander's horned sphere is a Cantor set.\u000aThe horned sphere as originally drawn by Alexander is illustrated above.
p25
aVThe word "algebra" is a distortion of the Arabic title of a treatise by al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b about algebraic methods. In modern usage, algebra has several meanings.\u000aOne use of the word "algebra" is the abstract study of number systems and operations within them, including such advanced topics as groups, rings, invariant theory, and cohomology. This is the meaning mathematicians associate with the word "algebra." When there is the possibility of confusion, this field of mathematics is often referred to as abstract algebra.
p26
aVIf r is a root of the polynomial equation\u000ax^n + a_(n - 1) x^(n - 1) + ... + a_1 x + a_0 = 0, where the a_is are integers and r satisfies no similar equation of degree <n, then r is called an algebraic integer of degree n. An algebraic integer is a special case of an algebraic number (for which the leading coefficient a_n need not equal 1). Radical integers are a subring of the algebraic integers.
p27
aVIf r is a root of a nonzero polynomial equation\u000aa_n x^n + a_(n - 1) x^(n - 1) + ... + a_1 x + a_0 = 0, where the a_is are integers (or equivalently, rational numbers) and r satisfies no similar equation of degree <n, then r is said to be an algebraic number of degree n.\u000aA number that is not algebraic is said to be transcendental. If r is an algebraic number and a_n = 1, then it is called an algebraic integer.
p28
aVThe set of roots of a polynomial f(x, y, z) = 0. An algebraic surface is said to be of degree n = max(i + j + k), where n is the maximum sum of powers of all terms a_m x^(i_m) y^(j_m) z^(k_m). The following table lists the names of algebraic surfaces of a given degree.
p29
aVGiven a power spectrum (a plot of power vs. frequency), aliasing is a false translation of power falling in some frequency range (-f_c, f_c) outside the range. Aliasing is caused by discrete sampling below the Nyquist frequency. It can be minimized by either increasing the underlying sampling rate or (if that is not practical or possible) pre-filtering the signal to suppress high-frequency components.
p30
aVAlpha is the name for the first letter in the Greek alphabet: \u03b1.\u000aIn finance, alpha is a financial measure giving the difference between a fund's actual return and its expected level of performance, given its level of risk (as measured by beta). A positive alpha indicates that a fund has performed better than expected based on its beta, whereas a negative alpha indicates poorer performance.
p31
aVAn alternating group is a group of even permutations on a set of length n, denoted A_n or Alt(n). Alternating groups are therefore permutation groups.\u000aThe nth alternating group is represented in the Wolfram Language as AlternatingGroup[n].\u000aAn alternating group is a normal subgroup of the permutation group, and has group order n!/2, the first few values of which for n = 2, 3, ... are 1, 3, 12, 60, 360, 2520, ... (OEIS A001710). The alternating group A_n is (n - 2)-transitive.
p32
aVAlso known as the Leibniz criterion. An alternating series converges if a_1 >=a_2 >=... and\u000alim_(k->\u221e) a_k = 0.
p33
aVThe altitudes of a triangle are the Cevians A_i H_i that are perpendicular to the legs A_j A_k opposite A_i. The three altitudes of any triangle are concurrent at the orthocenter H. This fundamental fact did not appear anywhere in Euclid's Elements.\u000aThe triangle \u0394H_1 H_2 H_3 connecting the feet of the altitudes is known as the orthic triangle.
p34
aVAn amicable pair (m, n) consists of two integers m, n for which the sum of proper divisors (the divisors excluding the number itself) of one number equals the other. Amicable pairs are occasionally called friendly pairs, although this nomenclature is to be discouraged since the numbers more commonly known as friendly pairs are defined by a different, albeit related, criterion. Symbolically, amicable pairs satisfy\u000as(m) | = | n\u000as(n) | = | m, where\u000as(n) congruent \u03c3(n) - n
p35
aVThe study of the geometry of figures by algebraic representation and manipulation of equations describing their positions, configurations, and separations. Analytic geometry is also called coordinate geometry since the objects are described as n-tuples of points (where n = 2 in the plane and 3 in space) in some coordinate system.
p36
aVGiven two intersecting lines or line segments, the amount of rotation about the point of intersection (the vertex) required to bring one into correspondence with the other is called the angle \u03b8 between them. The term "plane angle" is sometimes used to distinguish angles in a plane from solid angles measured in space.\u000aThe term "angle" can also be applied to the rotational offset between intersecting planes about their common line of intersection, in which case the angle is called the dihedral angle of the planes.\u000aAngles are usually measured in degrees (denoted °), radians (denoted rad, or without a unit), or sometimes gradians (denoted grad).
p37
aVThe (interior) bisector of an angle, also called the internal angle bisector, is the line or line segment that divides the angle into two equal parts.\u000aThe angle bisectors meet at the incenter I, which has trilinear coordinates 1:1:1.\u000aThe length t_1 of the bisector A_1 T_1 of angle A_1 in the above triangle \u0394A_1 A_2 A_3 is given by\u000at_1^2 = a_2 a_3[1 - a_1^2/(a_2 + a_3)^2], where t_i congruent (A_i T_i)^_ and a_i congruent (A_j A_k)^_.
p38
aVThe angle bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side in the same ratio as the sides adjacent to the angle.
p39
aVDivide an arbitrary angle into three equal angles using only a straightedge and compass.

aVanalysis of variance
p41
aVBecause even high-resolution computer monitors have a relatively small number of pixels, when graphics or text display distinguish between individual pixels. The result is that purportedly smooth curves are often rendered with jagged edges. This "jagged-edge" effect is called aliasing, and removing it is thus called antialiasing. For example, consider the approximation to a circle illustrated above, which is magnified three times. As can be seen, the sides of the circle are not smooth, but jagged and ugly.
p42
aVTwo points are antipodal (i.e., each is the antipode of the other) if they are diametrically opposite. Examples include endpoints of a line segment, or poles of a sphere. Given a point on a sphere with latitude \u03b4 and longitude \u03bb, the antipodal point has latitude -\u03b4 and longitude \u03bb ± 180° (where the sign is taken so that the result is between -180° and +180°).
p43
aVA semiregular polyhedron constructed with 2 n-gons and 2n triangles. The nets are particularly simple, consisting of two n-gons on top and bottom, separated by a ribbon of 2n triangles, with the two n-gons being offset by one ribbon segment. The duals of the antiprisms are the trapezohedra. The graph corresponding to the skeleton of an antiprism is known, not surprisingly, as an antiprism graph.\u000aThe sagitta of a regular n-gon of side length a has length\u000as = 1/2 atan(\u03c0/(2n)).
p44
aVApéry's constant is defined by\u000a\u03b6(3) = 1.20206..., (OEIS A002117) where \u03b6(z) is the Riemann zeta function. Apéry proved that \u03b6(3) is irrational, although it is not known if it is transcendental. Sorokin and Nesterenko subsequently constructed independent proofs for the irrationality of \u03b6(3). \u03b6(3) arises naturally in a number of physical problems, including in the second- and third-order terms of the electron's gyromagnetic ratio, computed using quantum electrodynamics.
p45
aVAn apodization function (also called a tapering function or window function) is a function used to smoothly bring a sampled signal down to zero at the edges of the sampled region. This suppresses leakage sidelobes which would otherwise be produced upon performing a discrete Fourier transform, but the suppression is at the expense of widening the lines, resulting in a decrease in the resolution.\u000aA number of apodization functions for symmetrical (two-sided) interferograms are summarized below, together with the instrument functions (or apparatus functions) they produce and a blowup of the instrument function sidelobes.
p46
aVConsider three mutually tangent circles, and draw their inner Soddy circle. Then draw the inner Soddy circles of this circle with each pair of the original three, and continue iteratively. The steps in the process are illustrated above.\u000aAn animation illustrating the construction of the gasket is shown above.\u000aThe points which are never inside a circle form a set of measure 0 having fractal dimension approximately 1.3058. The Apollonian gasket corresponds to a limit set that is invariant under a Kleinian group.
p47
aVThere are four completely different definitions of the so-called Apollonius circles: \u000a1. The set of all points whose distances from two fixed points are in a constant ratio 1:\u03bc. \u000a2. One of the eight circles that is simultaneously tangent to three given circles (i.e., a circle solving Apollonius' problem for three circles). \u000a3. One of the three circles passing through a vertex and both isodynamic points S and S' of a triangle.
p48
aVGiven three objects, each of which may be a point, line, or circle, draw a circle that is tangent to each. There are a total of ten cases. The two easiest involve three points or three lines, and the hardest involves three circles. Euclid solved the two easiest cases in his Elements, and the others (with the exception of the three circle problem), appeared in the Tangencies of Apollonius which was, however, lost. The general problem is, in principle, solvable by straightedge and compass alone.\u000aThe three-circle problem was solved by Viète, and the solutions are called Apollonius circles. There are eight total solutions.
p49
aVGiven a circle, the apothem is the perpendicular distance r from the midpoint of a chord to the circle's center. It is also equal to the radius R minus the sagitta h, r = R - h.\u000aFor a regular polygon, the apothem simply is the distance from the center to a side, i.e., the inradius r of the polygon.
p50
aVThe mathematical study of how given quantities can be approximated by other (usually simpler) ones under appropriate conditions. Approximation theory also studies the size and properties of the error introduced by approximation. Approximations are often obtained by power series expansions in which the higher order terms are dropped.

p52
aVThere are a number of meanings for the word "arc" in mathematics. In general, an arc is any smooth curve joining two points. The length of an arc is known as its arc length.\u000aIn a graph, a graph arc is an ordered pair of adjacent vertices.\u000aIn particular, an arc is any portion (other than the entire curve) of the circumference of a circle. An arc corresponding to the central angle \u2220AOC is denoted arcAC. Similarly, the size of the central angle subtended by this arc (i.e., the measure of the arc) is sometimes (e.g., Rhoad et al. 1984, p. 421) but not always denoted marcAC.
p53
aVThe 13 Archimedean solids are the convex polyhedra that have a similar arrangement of nonintersecting regular convex polygons of two or more different types arranged in the same way about each vertex with all sides the same length.
p54
aVDraw the perpendicular line from the intersection of the two small semicircles in the arbelos. The two circles C_1 and C_2 tangent to this line, the large semicircle, and each of the two semicircles are then congruent and known as Archimedes' circles.
p55
aVArchimedes' spiral is an Archimedean spiral with polar equation\u000ar = a\u03b8.\u000aThis spiral was studied by Conon, and later by Archimedes in On Spirals about 225 BC. Archimedes was able to work out the lengths of various tangents to the spiral.
p56
aVArc length is defined as the length along a curve, s congruent integral_\u03b3 left bracketing bar d\u2113 right bracketing bar , where d\u2113 is a differential displacement vector along a curve \u03b3. For example, for a circle of radius r, the arc length between two points with angles \u03b8_1 and \u03b8_2 (measured in radians) is simply\u000as = r left bracketing bar \u03b8_2 - \u03b8_1 right bracketing bar .
p57
aVThe area of a surface or lamina is the amount of material needed to "cover" it completely. The area of a surface or collection of surfaces bounding a solid is called, not surprisingly, the surface area.\u000aThe area of a region can be computed in the Wolfram Language using Area[reg].
p58
aVThe area element for a surface with first fundamental form\u000ads^2 = Edu^2 + 2Fdudv + Gdv^2\u000ais\u000adA = sqrt(EG - F^2) du\u22c0dv, where du\u22c0dv is the wedge product.

aVAn Argand diagram is a plot of complex numbers as points\u000az = x + iy\u000ain the complex plane using the x-axis as the real axis and y-axis as the imaginary axis. In the plot above, the dashed circle represents the complex modulus left bracketing bar z right bracketing bar of z and the angle \u03b8 represents its complex argument.
p60
aVIf f(z) is meromorphic in a region R enclosed by a contour \u03b3, let N be the number of complex roots of f(z) in \u03b3, and P be the number of poles in \u03b3, with each zero and pole counted as many times as its multiplicity and order, respectively. Then\u000aN - P = 1/(2\u03c0i) integral_\u03b3 (f'(z) dz)/(f(z)).\u000aDefining w congruent f(z) and \u03c3 congruent f(\u03b3) gives\u000aN - P = 1/(2\u03c0i) integral_\u03c3 (dw)/w.
p61
aVA paradox mentioned in the Greek work Mechanica, dubiously attributed to Aristotle. Consider the above diagram depicting a wheel consisting of two concentric circles of different diameters (a wheel within a wheel). There is a 1:1 correspondence of points on the large circle with points on the small circle, so the wheel should travel the same distance regardless of whether it is rolled from left to right on the top straight line or on the bottom one. this seems to imply that the two circumferences of different sized circles are equal, which is impossible.

aVArithmetic is the branch of mathematics dealing with integers or, more generally, numerical computation. Arithmetical operations include addition, congruence calculation, division, factorization, multiplication, power computation, root extraction, and subtraction. Arithmetic was part of the quadrivium taught in medieval universities. A mnemonic for the spelling of "arithmetic" is "a rat in the house may eat the ice cream."\u000aThe branch of mathematics known as number theory is sometimes known as higher arithmetic.\u000aModular arithmetic is the arithmetic of congruences.

aVLet\u000aa_(n + 1) | = | 1/2(a_n + b_n)\u000ab_(n + 1) | = | (2a_n b_n)/(a_n + b_n).\u000aThen\u000aA(a_0, b_0) = lim_(n->\u221e) a_n = lim_(n->\u221e) b_n = sqrt(a_0 b_0), which is just the geometric mean.

aVThe arithmetic mean of a set of values is the quantity commonly called "the" mean or the average. Given a set of samples {x_i}, the arithmetic mean is\u000ax^_ congruent 1/N sum_(i = 1)^N x_i .\u000aIt can be computed in the Wolfram Language using Mean[list].\u000aThe arithmetic mean is the special case M_1 of the power mean and is one of the Pythagorean means.\u000aWhen viewed as an estimator for the mean of the underlying distribution (known as the population mean), the arithmetic mean of a sample is called the sample mean.

aVAn arithmetic progression, also known as an arithmetic sequence, is a sequence of n numbers {a_0 + kd}_(k = 0)^(n - 1) such that the differences between successive terms is a constant d.\u000aAn arithmetic progression can be generated in the Wolfram Language using the command Range[a_1, a_n, d].

aVAn arithmetic series is the sum of a sequence {a_k}, k = 1, 2, ..., in which each term is computed from the previous one by adding (or subtracting) a constant d. Therefore, for k>1, a_k = a_(k - 1) + d = a_(k - 2) + 2d = ... = a_1 + d(k - 1).

It is given by the transformation\u000a[x_(n + 1)\u000ay_(n + 1)] = [1 | 1\u000a1 | 2][x_n\u000ay_n], where x_(n + 1) and y_(n + 1) are computed mod 1. The Arnold cat mapping is non-Hamiltonian, nonanalytic, and mixing. However, it is area-preserving since the determinant is 1.

p72
aVAn attractor is a set of states (points in the phase space), invariant under the dynamics, towards which neighboring states in a given basin of attraction asymptotically approach in the course of dynamic evolution. An attractor is defined as the smallest unit which cannot be itself decomposed into two or more attractors with distinct basins of attraction. This restriction is necessary since a dynamical system may have multiple attractors, each with its own basin of attraction.\u000aConservative systems do not have attractors, since the motion is periodic. For dissipative dynamical systems, however, volumes shrink exponentially so attractors have 0 volume in n-dimensional phase space.

aVLet {a_i}_(i = 0)^(N - 1) be a periodic sequence, then the autocorrelation of the sequence, sometimes called the periodic autocorrelation, is the sequence\u000a\u03c1_i = sum_(j = 0)^(N - 1) a_j a^__(j + i), where a^_ denotes the complex conjugate and the final subscript is understood to be taken modulo N.

Backtracking can greatly reduce the amount of work in an exhaustive search. Backtracking is implemented as Backtrack[s, partialQ, solutionQ] in the Wolfram Language package Combinatorica \u0300 .\u000aBacktracking also refers to a method of drawing fractals by appropriate numbering of the corresponding tree diagram which does not require storage of intermediate results.

p79
aVA puzzle involving disentangling a set of rings from a looped double rod, originally used by French peasants to lock chests. The word "baguenaudier" means "time-waster" in French, and the puzzle is also called the Chinese rings or Devil's needle puzzle. ("Bague" also means "ring, " but this appears to be an etymological coincidence. Interestingly, the bladder-senna tree is also known as "baguenaudier" in French.) Culin attributes the puzzle to Chinese general Hung Ming (A.D. 181-234), who gave it to his wife as a present to occupy her while he was away at the wars.\u000aThe solution of the baguenaudier is intimately related to the theory of Gray codes.

aVThe n-ball, denoted B^n, is the interior of a sphere S^(n - 1), and sometimes also called the n-disk. (Although physicists often use the term "sphere" to mean the solid ball, mathematicians definitely do not!)\u000aThe ball of radius r centered at point {x, y, z} is implemented in the Wolfram Language as Ball[{x, y, z}, r].\u000aThe equation for the surface area of the n-dimensional unit hypersphere S^n gives the recurrence relation\u000aS_(n + 2) = (2\u03c0S_n)/n.

aVSuppose A and B are candidates for office and there are 2n voters, n voting for A and n for B. In how many ways can the ballots be counted so that B is never ahead of A? The solution is a Catalan number C_n.\u000aA related problem also called "the" ballot problem is to let A receive a votes and B b votes with a>=b. This version of the ballot problem then asks for the probability that A stays ahead of B as the votes are counted. The solution is (a - b + 1)/(a + 1), as first shown by M. Bertrand. Another elegant solution was provided by André using the so-called André's reflection method.
p82
aVFirst stated in 1924, the Banach-Tarski paradox states that it is possible to decompose a ball into six pieces which can be reassembled by rigid motions to form two balls of the same size as the original. The number of pieces was subsequently reduced to five by Robinson, although the pieces are extremely complicated. (Five pieces are minimal, although four pieces are sufficient as long as the single point at the center is neglected.) A generalization of this theorem is that any two bodies in R^3 that do not extend to infinity and each containing a ball of arbitrary size can be dissected into each other (i.e., they are equidecomposable).

aVThe word "base" in mathematics is used to refer to a particular mathematical object that is used as a building block. The most common uses are the related concepts of the number system whose digits are used to represent numbers and the number system in which logarithms are defined. It can also be used to refer to the bottom edge or surface of a geometric figure.
p88
aVThe word basis can arise in several different contexts. Speaking in general terms, an object is "generated" by a basis in whatever manner is appropriate.\u000aFor example, a vector space can have a vector basis which spans the vector space by finite linear combinations.

aVThe Baum-Sweet sequence is the sequence of numbers {b_n} such that b_n = 1 if the binary representation of n contains no block of consecutive 0s of odd length, and b_n = 0 otherwise. For n = 1, 2, ... the first few terms are 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, ... (OEIS A086747). A recurrence plot of the limiting value of this sequence is illustrated above.

aVBayesian analysis is a statistical procedure which endeavors to estimate parameters of an underlying distribution based on the observed distribution. Begin with a "prior distribution" which may be based on anything, including an assessment of the relative likelihoods of parameters or the results of non-Bayesian observations. In practice, it is common to assume a uniform distribution over the appropriate range of values for the prior distribution.
p91
aVP(A_i|A) = P(A_i)P(A|A_i)/( sum_(j=1)^NP(A_j)P(A|A_j)), where P(A_i) is the probability of an event A_i, P(A_i|A) is the conditional probability of A_i given that A has already occurred, the events are disjoint, and union _(i = 1)^NA_i = A.
p92
aVThe bead-sorting algorithm orders a list of a positive integers increasingly by representing numbers as a list of a 1s, where each 1 stands for a bead. The k initial integers to be sorted are initially represented as left-aligned rows of beads, and in each step of the sorting process, a bead is slid down one unit if possible until each bead can no longer slide. For example, the graphic above shows the process for the numbers 7, 2, 1, 4, and 2.
p93
aVThe number of ways a set of n elements can be partitioned into nonempty subsets is called a Bell number and is denoted B_n (not to be confused with the Bernoulli number, which is also commonly denoted B_n).\u000aFor example, there are five ways the numbers {1, 2, 3} can be partitioned: {{1}, {2}, {3}}, {{1, 2}, {3}}, {{1, 3}, {2}}, {{1}, {2, 3}}, and {{1, 2, 3}}, so B_3 = 5.

p95
aVThe Bernoulli distribution is a discrete distribution having two possible outcomes labelled by n = 0 and n = 1 in which n = 1 ("success") occurs with probability p and n = 0 ("failure") occurs with probability q congruent 1 - p, where 0<p<1. It therefore has probability density function\u000aP(n) = {1 - p | for n = 0\u000ap | for n = 1, auto right match \u000awhich can also be written\u000aP(n) = p^n (1 - p)^(1 - n) .
p96
aVThe Bernoulli inequality states\u000a(1 + x)^n>1 + nx, where x>-1!=0 is a real number and n>1 an integer.\u000aThis inequality can be proven by taking a Maclaurin series of (1 + x)^n, (1 + x)^n = 1 + nx + 1/2 n(n - 1) x^2 + 1/6 n(n - 1)(n - 2) x^3 + ....\u000aSince the series terminates after a finite number of terms for integral n, the Bernoulli inequality for x>0 is obtained by truncating after the first-order term.

aVWhen the index \u03bd is real, the functions J_\u03bd(z), J_\u03bd^, (z), Y_\u03bd(z), and Y_\u03bd^, (z) each have an infinite number of real zeros, all of which are simple with the possible exception of z = 0. For nonnegative \u03bd, the kth positive zeros of these functions are denoted j_(\u03bd, k), j_(\u03bd, k)^, , y_(\u03bd, k), and y_(\u03bd, k)^, , respectively, except that z = 0 is typically counted as the first zero of J_0^, (z).\u000aThe first few roots j_(n, k) of the Bessel function J_n(x) are given in the following table for small nonnegative integer values of n and k.

aVA general type of statistical distribution which is related to the gamma distribution. Beta distributions have two free parameters, which are labeled according to one of two notational conventions. The usual definition calls these \u03b1 and \u03b2, and the other uses \u03b2' congruent \u03b2 - 1 and \u03b1' congruent \u03b1 - 1. The beta distribution is used as a prior distribution for binomial proportions in Bayesian analysis . The above plots are for various values of (\u03b1, \u03b2) with \u03b1 = 1 and \u03b2 ranging from 0.25 to 3.00.

aVBézout's theorem for curves states that, in general, two algebraic curves of degrees m and n intersect in m·n points and cannot meet in more than m·n points unless they have a component in common (i.e., the equations defining them have a common factor; Coolidge 1959, p. 10).\u000aBézout's theorem for polynomials states that if P and Q are two polynomials with no roots in common, then there exist two other polynomials A and B such that AP + BQ = 1. Similarly, given N polynomial equations of degrees n_1, n_2, ...n_N in N variables, there are in general n_1 n_2 ...n_N common solutions.\u000aSéroul uses the term Bézout's theorem for the following two theorems.

aVIn a dynamical system, a bifurcation is a period doubling, quadrupling, etc., that accompanies the onset of chaos. It represents the sudden appearance of a qualitatively different solution for a nonlinear system as some parameter is varied. The illustration above shows bifurcations (occurring at the location of the blue lines) of the logistic map as the parameter r is varied. Bifurcations come in four basic varieties: flip bifurcation, fold bifurcation, pitchfork bifurcation, and transcritical bifurcation.

aVA map is called bijective if it is both injective and surjective. A bijective map is also called a bijection. A function f admits an inverse f^(-1) (i.e., "f is invertible") iff it is bijective.\u000aTwo sets X and Y are called bijective if there is a bijective map from X to Y. In this sense, "bijective" is a synonym for "equipollent" (or "equipotent"). Bijectivity is an equivalence relation on the class of sets.

aVThe game of billiards is played on a rectangular table (known as a billiard table) upon which balls are placed. One ball (the "cue ball") is then struck with the end of a "cue" stick, causing it to bounce into other balls and reflect off the sides of the table. Real billiards can involve spinning the ball so that it does not travel in a straight line, but the mathematical study of billiards generally consists of reflections in which the reflection and incidence angles are the same. However, strange table shapes such as circles and ellipses are often considered. The popular 1959 animated short film Donald in Mathmagic Land features a tutorial by Donald Duck on how to win at billiards using the diamonds normally inscribed around the edge of a real billiard table.

This base is used in computers, since all numbers can be simply represented as a string of electrically pulsed ons and offs. In computer parlance, one binary digit is called a bit, two digits are called a crumb, four digits are called a nibble, and eight digits are called a byte.

aVThe Bonferroni correction is a multiple-comparison correction used when several dependent or independent statistical tests are being performed simultaneously (since while a given alpha value \u03b1 may be appropriate for each individual comparison, it is not for the set of all comparisons). In order to avoid a lot of spurious positives, the alpha value needs to be lowered to account for the number of comparisons being performed.

aVA Boolean algebra is a mathematical structure that is similar to a Boolean ring, but that is defined using the meet and join operators instead of the usual addition and multiplication operators. Explicitly, a Boolean algebra is the partial order on subsets defined by inclusion, i.e., the Boolean algebra b(A) of a set A is the set of subsets of A that can be obtained by means of a finite number of the set operations union (OR), intersection (AND), and complementation (NOT). A Boolean algebra also forms a lattice, and each of the elements of b(A) is called a Boolean function. There are 2^(2^n) Boolean functions in a Boolean algebra of order n.
p139
aVConsider a Boolean algebra of subsets b(A) generated by a set A, which is the set of subsets of A that can be obtained by means of a finite number of the set operations union, intersection, and complementation. Then each of the elements of b(A) is called a Boolean function generated by A. Each Boolean function has a unique representation (up to order) as a union of complete products. It follows that there are 2^(2^p) inequivalent Boolean functions for a set A with cardinality p.

Then Boole's rule approximating the integral of f(x) is given by the Newton-Cotes-like formula\u000a integral_(x_1)^(x_5) f(x) dx = 2/45 h(7f_1 + 32f_2 + 12f_3 + 32f_4 + 7f_5) - 8/945 h^7 f^(6)(\u03be).\u000aThis formula is frequently and mistakenly known as Bode's rule as a result of a typo in an early reference, but is actually due to Boole.

aVThe bootstrap method is a computer-based method for assigning measures of accuracy to sample estimates.

aVThe Borromean rings, also called the Borromean links are three mutually interlocked rings, named after the Italian Renaissance family who used them on their coat of arms. The configuration of rings is also known as a "Ballantine, " and a brand of beer (right figure; Falstaff Brewing Corporation) has been brewed under this name. In the Borromean rings, no two rings are linked, so if any one of the rings is cut, all three rings fall apart. Any number of rings can be linked in an analogous manner.\u000aThe Borromean rings are a prime link. They have link symbol 06-0302, braid word \u03c3_1^(-1) \u03c3_2 \u03c3_1^(-1) \u03c3_2 \u03c3_1^(-1) \u03c3_2, and are also the simplest Brunnian link.

aVThere are three types of boundary conditions commonly encountered in the solution of partial differential equations: \u000a1. Dirichlet boundary conditions specify the value of the function on a surface T = f(r, t). \u000a2.

aVA box-and-whisker plot (sometimes called simply a box plot) is a histogram-like method of displaying data, invented by J. Tukey. To create a box-and-whisker plot, draw a box with ends at the quartiles Q_1 and Q_3. Draw the statistical median M as a horizontal line in the box. Now extend the "whiskers" to the farthest points that are not outliers (i.e., that are within 3/2 times the interquartile range of Q_1 and Q_3). Then, for every point more than 3/2 times the interquartile range from the end of a box, draw a dot. If two dots have the same value, draw them side by side. Box-and-whisker plots are implemented as BoxWhiskerPlot[data] in the Wolfram Language package StatisticalPlots \u0300 .

aVIn complex analysis, a branch (also called a sheet) is a portion of the range of a multivalued function over which the function is single-valued. Combining all the sheets gives the full structure of the function. It is often convenient to choose a particular branch of a function to work with, and this choice is often designated the "principal branch" (or "principal sheet").\u000aIn graph theory, a branch at a point u in a tree is a maximal subtree containing u as an endpoint.

aVA branch cut is a curve (with ends possibly open, closed, or half-open) in the complex plane across which an analytic multivalued function is discontinuous. For convenience, branch cuts are often taken as lines or line segments. Branch cuts (even those consisting of curves) are also known as cut lines, slits, or branch lines.

It states that, given a hexagon circumscribed on a conic section, the lines joining opposite polygon vertices (polygon diagonals) meet in a single point.\u000aIn 1847, Möbius gave a statement which generalizes Brianchon's theorem: if all lines (except possibly one) connecting two opposite vertices of a (4n + 2)-gon circumscribed on a conic section meet in one point, then the same is true for the remaining line.

aVA busy beaver is an n-state, 2-color Turing machine which writes a maximum number \u03a3(n) of 1s before halting. Alternatively, some authors define a busy beaver as a Turing machine that performs a maximum number S(n) of steps when started on an initially blank tape before halting. The process leading to the solution of the three-state machine is discussed by Lin and Rado and the process leading to the solution of the four-state machine is discussed by Brady and Machlin and Stout.

aVGiven a chord PQ of a circle, draw any other two chords AB and CD passing through its midpoint. Call the points where AD and BC meet PQ X and Y. Then M is also the midpoint of XY. There are a number of proofs of this theorem, including those by W. G. Horner, Johnson, and Coxeter (1987, pp. 78 and 144). The latter concise proof employs projective geometry.\u000aThe following proof is given by Coxeter and Greitzer. In the figure at right, drop perpendiculars x_1 and y_1 from X and Y to AB, and x_2 and Y_2 from X and Y to CD.

aVCaesar's method is an encryption scheme involving shifting an alphabet (so a->c, b->d, c->e, d->f, etc., x->z, y->a, z->b). It is one of the most basic encryption methods, and is a specialized form of a transposition cipher.\u000aBecause the alphabet is rotated, the shift is consistent. A mapping of a->b, b->c, etc. is termed ROT 1 because the letters are shifted by one. Note that z would map to a due to the circular aspect of the rotation.\u000aEncrypting with ROT \u03b1 and ROT \u03b2 yields the same ciphertext if and only if \u03b1 congruent \u03b2 (mod 26).

aVThe café wall illusion, sometimes also called the Münsterberg illusion (Ashton Raggatt McDougall 2006), is an optical illusion produced by a black and white rectangular tessellation when the tiles are shifted in a zigzag pattern, as illustrated above. While the pattern seems to diverge towards the upper and lower right corners in the upper figure, the gray lines are actually parallel. Interestingly, the illusion greatly diminishes if black lines are used instead of gray.\u000aGregory and Heard first noticed the illusion on the wall decoration of a café in Bristol, England. The café wall illusion is only one among many visual distortion effects involving parallel lines. The most famous example of this kind is Zöllner's illusion.

When v is not explicitly stated, the term "g-cage" generally refers to a (3, g)-cage.\u000aA list of cage graphs can be obtained in the Wolfram Language using GraphData["Cage"].\u000aThere are a number of special cases. The (2, g)-cage is the cycle graph C_g, the (v, 2)-cage is the multigraph of v edges on two vertices, the (v, 3)-cage is the complete graph K_(v + 1), and the (v, 4)-cage is the bipartite graph K_(v, v).

aVCalabi-Yau spaces are important in string theory, where one model posits the geometry of the universe to consist of a ten-dimensional space of the form M×V, where M is a four dimensional manifold (space-time) and V is a six dimensional compact Calabi-Yau space. They are related to Kummer surfaces. Although the main application of Calabi-Yau spaces is in theoretical physics, they are also interesting from a purely mathematical standpoint. Consequently, they go by slightly different names, depending mostly on context, such as Calabi-Yau manifolds or Calabi-Yau varieties.

Calculus of variations seeks to find the path, curve, surface, etc., for which a given function has a stationary value (which, in physical problems, is usually a minimum or maximum).

aVCartesian coordinates are rectilinear two- or three-dimensional coordinates (and therefore a special case of curvilinear coordinates) which are also called rectangular coordinates. The two axes of two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, conventionally denoted the x- and y-axes (a notation due to Descartes), are chosen to be linear and mutually perpendicular. Typically, the x-axis is thought of as the "left and right" or horizontal axis while the y-axis is thought of as the "up and down" or vertical axis. In two dimensions, the coordinates x and y may lie anywhere in the interval (-\u221e, \u221e), and an ordered pair (x, y) in two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates is often called a point or a 2-vector.

aVThe Cassini ovals are a family of quartic curves, also called Cassini ellipses, described by a point such that the product of its distances from two fixed points a distance 2a apart is a constant b^2. The shape of the curve depends on b/a. If a<b, the curve is a single loop with an oval (left figure above) or dog bone (second figure) shape. The case a = b produces a lemniscate (third figure).

aVA tree in which each non-leaf graph vertex has a constant number of branches n is called an n-Cayley tree. 2-Cayley trees are path graphs. The unique n-Cayley tree on n + 1 nodes is the star graph. The illustration above shows the first few 3-Cayley trees (also called trivalent trees, binary trees, or boron trees). The numbers of binary trees on n = 1, 2, ... nodes (i.e., n-node trees having vertex degree either 1 or 3; also called 3-Cayley trees, 3-valent trees, or boron trees) are 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0 , 4, 0, 6, 0, 11, ...

aVA cellular automaton is a collection of "colored" cells on a grid of specified shape that evolves through a number of discrete time steps according to a set of rules based on the states of neighboring cells. The rules are then applied iteratively for as many time steps as desired. von Neumann was one of the first people to consider such a model, and incorporated a cellular model into his "universal constructor." Cellular automata were studied in the early 1950s as a possible model for biological systems. Comprehensive studies of cellular automata have been performed by S. Wolfram starting in the 1980s, and Wolfram's fundamental research in the field culminated in the publication of his book A New Kind of Science in which Wolfram presents a gigantic collection of results concerning automata, among which are a number of groundbreaking new discoveries.\u000aThe Season 2 episode "Bettor or Worse" of the television crime drama NUMB3RS mentions one-dimensional cellular automata.\u000aCellular automata come in a variety of shapes and varieties. One of the most fundamental properties of a cellular automaton is the type of grid on which it is computed. The simplest such "grid" is a one-dimensional line. In two dimensions, square, triangular, and hexagonal grids may be considered. Cellular automata may also be constructed on Cartesian grids in arbitrary numbers of dimensions, with the d-dimensional integer lattice Z^d being the most common choice. Cellular automata on a d-dimensional integer lattice are implemented in the Wolfram Language as CellularAutomaton[rule, init, steps].\u000aThe number of colors (or distinct states) k a cellular automaton may assume must also be specified. This number is typically an integer, with k = 2 (binary) being the simplest choice. For a binary automaton, color 0 is commonly called "white, " and color 1 is commonly called "black". However, cellular automata having a continuous range of possible values may also be considered.\u000aIn addition to the grid on which a cellular automaton lives and the colors its cells may assume, the neighborhood over which cells affect one another must also be specified. The simplest choice is "nearest neighbors, " in which only cells directly adjacent to a given cell may be affected at each time step. Two common neighborhoods in the case of a two-dimensional cellular automaton on a square grid are the so-called Moore neighborhood (a square neighborhood) and the von Neumann neighborhood (a diamond-shaped neighborhood).\u000aThe simplest type of cellular automaton is a binary, nearest-neighbor, one-dimensional automaton. Such automata were called "elementary cellular automata" by S. Wolfram, who has extensively studied their amazing properties (Wolfram 1983; 2002, p. 57). There are 256 such automata, each of which can be indexed by a unique binary number whose decimal representation is known as the "rule" for the particular automaton. An illustration of rule 30 is shown above together with the evolution it produces after 15 steps starting from a single black cell.\u000aA slightly more complicated class of cellular automata are the nearest-neighbor, k-color, one-dimensional totalistic cellular automata. In such automata, it is the average of adjacent cells that determine the evolution, and the simplest nontrivial examples have k = 3 colors. For these automata, the set of rules describing the behavior can be encoded as a (3k - 2)-digit k-ary number known as a "code." The rules and 300 steps of the ternary (k = 3) code 912 automaton are illustrated above.\u000aIn two dimensions, the best-known cellular automaton is Conway's game of life, discovered by J. H. Conway in 1970 and popularized in Martin Gardner's Scientific American columns. The game of life is a binary (k = 2) totalistic cellular automaton with a Moore neighborhood of range r = 1. Although the computation of successive game of life generations was originally done by hand, the computer revolution soon arrived and allowed more extensive patterns to be studied and propagated. An animation of the game of life construction known as a puffer train is illustrated above.\u000aWireWorld is another common two-dimensional cellular automaton.\u000aThe theory of cellular automata is immensely rich, with simple rules and structures being capable of producing a great variety of unexpected behaviors. For example, there exist universal cellular automata that are capable of simulating the behavior of any other cellular automaton or Turing machine. It has even been proved by Gacs that there exist fault-tolerant universal cellular automata, whose ability to simulate other cellular automata is not hindered by random perturbations provided that such perturbations are sufficiently sparse.

Then draw the next point a fraction r of the distance between it and a polygon vertex picked at random. Continue the process (after throwing out the first few points). The result of this "chaos game" is sometimes, but not always, a fractal. The results of the chaos game are shown above for several values of (n, r).\u000aThe above plots show the chaos game for 10000 points in the regular 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-gons with r = 1/2.

aVGiven a subset A of a larger set, the characteristic function \u03c7_A, sometimes also called the indicator function, is the function defined to be identically one on A, and is zero elsewhere. Characteristic functions are sometimes denoted using the so-called Iverson bracket, and can be useful descriptive devices since it is easier to say, for example, "the characteristic function of the primes" rather than repeating a given definition. A characteristic function is a special case of a simple function.

The most played variants are western chess, Shogi (in Japan), and Xiangqi (in China).\u000aThe western version of chess is a game played on an 8×8 board, called a chessboard, of alternating black and white squares. Pieces with different types of allowed moves are placed on the board, a set of black pieces in the first two rows and a set of white pieces in the last two rows. The pieces are called the bishop (2), king (1), knight (2), pawn (8), queen (1), and rook (2). The object of the game is to capture the opponent's king.

aVThe chromatic polynomial \u03c0_G(z) of an undirected graph G, also denoted C(G;z) and P(G, x), is a polynomial which encodes the number of distinct ways to color the vertices of G (where colorings are counted as distinct even if they differ only by permutation of colors). For a graph G on n vertices that can be colored in k_0 = 0 ways with no colors, k_1 way with one color, ..., and k_n ways with n colors, the chromatic polynomial of G is defined as the unique Lagrange interpolating polynomial of degree n through the n + 1 points (0, k_0), (1, k_1), ..., (n, k_n). Evaluating the chromatic polynomial in variables z at the points z = 1, 2, ..., n then recovers the numbers of 1-, 2-, ..., and n-colorings. In fact, evaluating \u03c0_G(z) at integers k>n still gives the numbers of k-colorings.\u000aThe chromatic number of a graph gives the smallest number of colors with which a graph can be colored, which is therefore the smallest positive integer z such that \u03c0_G(z)>0.\u000aFor example, the cubical graph Q_3 has 1-, 2-, ... k-coloring counts of 0, 2, 114, 2652, 29660, 198030, 932862, 3440024, ... (OEIS A140986), resulting in chromatic polynomial\u000a\u03c0_(Q_3)(z) = z^8 - 12z^7 + 66z^6 - 214z^5 + 441z^4 - 572z^3 + 423z^2 - 133z.\u000aEvaluating \u03c0_(Q_3)(z) at z = 1, 2, ... then gives 0, 2, 114, 2652, 29660, 198030, 932862, 3440024, ... as expected.\u000aThe chromatic polynomial of a graph g in the variable z can be determined in the Wolfram Language using ChromaticPolynomial[g, x]. Precomputed chromatic polynomials for many named graphs can be obtained using GraphData[graph, ChromaticPolynomial][z].\u000aThe chromatic polynomial is multiplicative over graph components, so for a graph G having connected components G_1, G_2, ..., the chromatic polynomial of G itself is given by\u000a\u03c0_G = \u03c0_(G_1) \u03c0_(G_2) ....\u000aThe chromatic polynomial for a forest on n vertices, m edges, and with c connected components is given by\u000a\u03c0 = (-1)^(n - c) x^c (1 - x)^m .\u000aFor a graph with vertex count n and c connected components, the chromatic polynomial \u03c0(x) is related to the rank polynomial R(x, y) and Tutte polynomial T(x, y) by\u000a\u03c0(x) | = | x^n R(-x^(-1), -1)\u000a | = | (-1)^(n - c) x^c T(1 - x, 0)\u000a(extending Biggs 1993, p. 106). The chromatic polynomial of a planar graph G is related to the flow polynomial C_G^*(u) of its dual graph G^* by\u000a\u03c0_G(x) = xC_(G^*)^*(x).\u000aChromatic polynomials are not diagnostic for graph isomorphism, i.e., two nonisomorphic graphs may share the same chromatic polynomial. A graph that is determined by its chromatic polynomial is said to be a chromatically unique graph; nonisomorphic graphs sharing the same chromatic polynomial are said to be chromatically equivalent.\u000aThe following table summarizes the chromatic polynomials for some simple graphs.

Picking random points on a circle is therefore a great deal more straightforward than sphere point picking.\u000an random points can be picked on a unit circle in the Wolfram Language using the function RandomPoint[Circle[], n].\u000aRandom points on a circle can also be obtained by picking two numbers x_1, x_2 from a uniform distribution on (-1, 1), and rejecting pairs with x_1^2 + x_2^2 >=1.

aVThe circumcenter is the center O of a triangle's circumcircle. It can be found as the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors. The trilinear coordinates of the circumcenter are\u000acosA:cosB:cosC, and the exact trilinear coordinates are therefore\u000aRcosA:RcosB:RcosC, where R is the circumradius, or equivalently\u000a(1/2 acotA, 1/2 bcotB, 1/2 ccotC).\u000aThe circumcenter is Kimberling center X_3.
p238
aVThe circumcircle is a triangle's circumscribed circle, i.e., the unique circle that passes through each of the triangle's three vertices. The center O of the circumcircle is called the circumcenter, and the circle's radius R is called the circumradius. A triangle's three perpendicular bisectors M_A, M_B, and M_C meet at O. The Steiner point S and Tarry point T lie on the circumcircle.

aVWhile some authors define "circumference" as distance around an arbitrary closed object (sometimes restricted to a closed curved object), in the work, the term "perimeter" is used for this purpose and "circumference" is restricted to mean the perimeter of a circle.\u000aFor radius r or diameter d = 2r, C = 2\u03c0r = \u03c0d, where \u03c0 is pi.\u000aThe term "circumference" is also sometimes used to refer to the "enclosing boundary" itself of a curved lamina or disk.
p240
aVThe circumradius of a cyclic polygon is a radius of the circle inside which the polygon can be inscribed. Similarly, the circumradius of a polyhedron is the radius of a circumsphere touching each of the polyhedron's vertices, if such a sphere exists. Every triangle and every tetrahedron has a circumradius, but not all polygons or polyhedra do. However, regular polygons and regular polyhedra posses a circumradius.\u000aThe following table summarizes the inradii from some nonregular circumscriptable polygons.

aVGiven two curves C_1 and C_2 and a fixed point O, let a line from O cut C_1 at Q and C_2 at R. Then the locus of a point P such that OP = QR is the cissoid. The word cissoid means "ivy shaped."

aVClean tile is a game investigated by Buffon in which players bet on the number of different tiles a thrown coin will partially cover on a floor that is regularly tiled. Buffon investigated the probabilities on a triangular grid, square grid, hexagonal grid, and grid composed of rhombi. Assume that the side length of the tile l is greater than the coin diameter d. Then, on a square grid, it is possible for a coin to land so that it partially covers 1, 2, 3, or 4 tiles. On a triangular grid, it can land on 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 tiles. On a hexagonal grid, it can land on 1, 2, or 3 tiles.\u000aSpecial cases of this game give the Buffon-Laplace needle problem (for a square grid) and Buffon's needle problem (for infinite equally spaced parallel lines).

aVThe Clebsch graph, also known as the Greenwood-Gleason graph (Read and Wilson, 1998, p. 284) and illustrated above in a number of embeddings, is a strongly regular quintic graph on 16 vertices and 40 edges with parameters (\u03bd, k, \u03bb, \u03bc) = (16, 5, 0, 2). In fact, it is the unique strongly regular graph with these parameters.\u000aNote that Brouwer et al. (1989, pp. 104 and 224) confusingly use the term "Clebsch graph" to refer to the halved 5-cube graph, which is strongly regular on parameters (16, 10, 6, 6).\u000aThe Clebsch graph is isomorphic to the 16-cyclotomic graph and 2-Keller graph.

aVLet V be an n-dimensional linear space over a field K, and let Q be a quadratic form on V. A Clifford algebra is then defined over T(V)/I(Q), where T(V) is the tensor algebra over V and I is a particular ideal of T(V).\u000aClifford algebraists call their higher dimensional numbers hypercomplex even though they do not share all the properties of complex numbers and no classical function theory can be constructed over them.
p245
aVA clique of a graph G is a complete subgraph of G, and the clique of largest possible size is referred to as a maximum clique. However, care is needed since maximum cliques are often called simply "cliques". A maximal clique is a clique that cannot be extended by including one more adjacent vertex, meaning it is not a subset of a larger clique. Maximum cliques are therefore maximal cliqued (but not necessarily vice versa).\u000aCliques arise in a number of areas of graph theory and combinatorics, including graph coloring and the theory of error-correcting codes.
p246
aVThe clique graph of a given graph G is the graph intersection of the family of cliques of G. A graph G is a clique graph iff it contains a family F of complete subgraphs whose graph union is G, such that whenever every pair of such complete graphs in some subfamily F' has a nonempty graph intersection, the intersection of all members of F' is not empty.
p247
aVThe clique number of a graph G, denoted \u03c9(G), is the number of vertices in a maximum clique of G. Equivalently, it is the size of a largest clique or maximal clique of G.\u000aFor an arbitrary graph, \u03c9(G)>= sum_(i = 1)^n 1/(n - d_i), where d_i is the degree of graph vertex i. In addition, the chromatic number \u03c7(G) of a graph G is equal to or greater than its clique number \u03c9(G), i.e., \u03c7(G)>=\u03c9(G).

aVCluster analysis is a technique used for classification of data in which data elements are partitioned into groups called clusters that represent collections of data elements that are proximate based on a distance or dissimilarity function.\u000aCluster analysis is implemented as FindClusters[data] or FindClusters[data, n].

aVCoding theory, sometimes called algebraic coding theory, deals with the design of error-correcting codes for the reliable transmission of information across noisy channels. It makes use of classical and modern algebraic techniques involving finite fields, group theory, and polynomial algebra. It has connections with other areas of discrete mathematics, especially number theory and the theory of experimental designs.

aVAfter a half rotation of the coin on the left around the central coin (of the same radius), the coin undergoes a complete rotation. In other words, a coin makes two complete rotations when rolled around the boundary of an identical coin. This fact is readily apparent in the generation of the cardioid as one disk rolling on another.
p253
aVLet there be n>=2 integers 0<a_1<...<a_n with GCD(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) = 1. The values a_i represent the denominations of n different coins, where these denominations have greatest common divisor of 1. The sums of money that can be represented using the given coins are then given by\u000aN = sum_(i = 1)^n a_i x_i,
p254
aVAn idealized coin consists of a circular disk of zero thickness which, when thrown in the air and allowed to fall, will rest with either side face up ("heads" H or "tails" T) with equal probability. A coin is therefore a two-sided die. Despite slight differences between the sides and nonzero thickness of actual coins, the distribution of their tosses makes a good approximation to a p = 1/2 Bernoulli distribution.

aVThree or more points P_1, P_2, P_3, ..., are said to be collinear if they lie on a single straight line L. A line on which points lie, especially if it is related to a geometric figure such as a triangle, is sometimes called an axis.\u000aTwo points are trivially collinear since two points determine a line.\u000aThree points x_i = (x_i, y_i, z_i) for i = 1, 2, 3 are collinear iff the ratios of distances satisfy\u000ax_2 - x_1 :y_2 - y_1 :z_2 - z_1 = x_3 - x_1 :y_3 - y_1 :z_3 - z_1 .
p258
aVA coloring of plane regions, link segments, etc., is an assignment of a distinct labeling (which could be a number, letter, color, etc.) to each component. Coloring problems generally involve topological considerations (i.e., they depend on the abstract study of the arrangement of objects), and theorems about colorings, such as the famous four-color theorem, can be extremely difficult to prove.

aVThe number of ways of picking k unordered outcomes from n possibilities. Also known as the binomial coefficient or choice number and read "n choose k, "\u000a_n C_k congruent (n\u000ak) congruent (n!)/(k!(n - k)!), where n! is a factorial. For example, there are (4\u000a2) = 6 combinations of two elements out of the set {1, 2, 3, 4}, namely {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, and {3, 4}. These combinations are known as k-subsets.
p260
aVIn December 1920, M. Schönfinkel presented in a report to the Mathematical Society in Göttingen a new type of formal logic based on the concept of a generalized function whose argument is also a function. This mathematical discipline was subsequently termed combinatory logic by Curry and "\u03bb-conversion" or "\u03bb-calculus" by Church. Combinators can be used in the study of algebra, topology, and category theory, and have found application in the study of programs in algorithmic languages.
p261
aVCombinatorics is the branch of mathematics studying the enumeration, combination, and permutation of sets of elements and the mathematical relations that characterize their properties.\u000aMathematicians sometimes use the term "combinatorics" to refer to a larger subset of discrete mathematics that includes graph theory. In that case, what is commonly called combinatorics is then referred to as "enumeration."\u000aThe Season 1 episode "Noisy Edge" of the television crime drama NUMB3RS mentions combinatorics.

aVA common fraction is a fraction in which numerator and denominator are both integers, as opposed to fractions. For example, 2/5 is a common fraction, while\u000a(1/3)/(2/5)\u000ais not. Common fractions are sometimes also called vulgar fractions.
p263
aVTwo elements x and y of a set S are said to be commutative under a binary operation * if they satisfy\u000ax*y = y*x.\u000aReal numbers are commutative under addition\u000ax + y = y + x\u000aand multiplication\u000ax·y = y·x.\u000aThe Wolfram Language attribute that sets a function to be commutative is Orderless.

An Associative R-algebra is commutative if x·y = y·x for all x, y element A. Similarly, a ring is commutative if the multiplication operation is commutative, and a Lie algebra is commutative if the commutator [A, B] is 0 for every A and B in the Lie algebra.
p265
aVTwo algebraic objects that are commutative, i.e., A and B such that A*B = B*A for some operation *, are said to commute with each other.
p266
aVA compactification of a topological space X is a larger space Y containing X which is also compact. The smallest compactification is the one-point compactification. For example, the real line is not compact. It is contained in the circle, which is obtained by adding a point at infinity. Similarly, the plane is compactified by adding one point at infinity, giving the sphere.\u000aA topological space X has a compactification if and only if it is completely regular and a T_1-space.
p267
aVA function has compact support if it is zero outside of a compact set. Alternatively, one can say that a function has compact support if its support is a compact set. For example, the function f:x->x^2 in its entire domain (i.e., f:R->R^+) does not have compact support, while any bump function does have compact support.

aVA complete bipartite graph, sometimes also called a complete bicolored graph (Erd\u1e26 os et al. 1965) or complete bigraph, is a bipartite graph (i.e., a set of graph vertices decomposed into two disjoint sets such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent) such that every pair of graph vertices in the two sets are adjacent. If there are p and q graph vertices in the two sets, the complete bipartite graph is denoted K_(p, q). The above figures show K_(3, 2) and K_(2, 5).\u000aK_(3, 3) is also known as the utility graph (and is the circulant graph Ci_(1, 3)(6)), and is the unique 4-cage graph.
p270
aVA complete graph is a graph in which each pair of graph vertices is connected by an edge. The complete graph with n graph vertices is denoted K_n and has (n\u000a2) = n(n - 1)/2 (the triangular numbers) undirected edges, where (n\u000ak) is a binomial coefficient. In older literature, complete graphs are sometimes called universal graphs.

aVTwo complex numbers z = x + iy and z' = x' + iy' are added together componentwise, z + z' = (x + x') + i(y + y').\u000aIn component form, (x, y) + (x', y') = (x + x', y + y')\u000a(Krantz 1999, p. 1).
p274
aVA complex number z may be represented as\u000az congruent x + iy = left bracketing bar z right bracketing bar e^(i\u03b8), where left bracketing bar z right bracketing bar is a positive real number called the complex modulus of z, and \u03b8 (sometimes also denoted \u03d5) is a real number called the argument. The argument is sometimes also known as the phase or, more rarely and more confusingly, the amplitude (Derbyshire 2004, pp. 180-181 and 376).\u000aThe complex argument of a number z is implemented in the Wolfram Language as Arg[z].
p275
aVA complex number may be taken to the power of another complex number. In particular, complex exponentiation satisfies\u000a(a + bi)^(c + di) = (a^2 + b^2)^((c + id)/2) e^(i(c + id) arg(a + ib)), where arg(z) is the complex argument.

aVTwo complex numbers x = a + ib and y = c + id are multiplied as follows:\u000axy | = | (a + ib)(c + id)\u000a | = | ac + ibc + iad - bd\u000a | = | (ac - bd) + i(ad + bc).\u000aIn component form, (x, y)(x', y') = (xx' - yy', xy' + yx')\u000a(Krantz 1999, p. 1). The special case of a complex number multiplied by a scalar a is then given by\u000aa(x, y) = (a, 0)(x, y) = (ax, ay).
p280
aVThe complex numbers are the field C of numbers of the form x + iy, where x and y are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit equal to the square root of -1, sqrt(-1). When a single letter z = x + iy is used to denote a complex number, it is sometimes called an "affix." In component notation, z = x + iy can be written (x, y). The field of complex numbers includes the field of real numbers as a subfield.
p281
aVThe complex plane is the plane of complex numbers spanned by the vectors 1 and i, where i is the imaginary number. Every complex number corresponds to a unique point in the complex plane. The line in the plane with i = 0 is the real line. The complex plane is sometimes called the Argand plane or Gauss plane, and a plot of complex numbers in the plane is sometimes called an Argand diagram.\u000aThe complex plane together with the point at infinity C union {\u221e} is known as the Riemann sphere or extended complex plane and denoted C^* or C^^. However, the notation C^* is also used to denote the punctured plane C - {0}.

aVThe constant a_(-1) in the Laurent series\u000af(z) = sum_(n = - \u221e)^\u221e a_n (z - z_0)^n\u000aof f(z) about a point z_0 is called the residue of f(z). If f is analytic at z_0, its residue is zero, but the converse is not always true (for example, 1/z^2 has residue of 0 at z = 0 but is not analytic at z = 0). The residue of a function f at a point z_0 may be denoted Res_(z = z_0)(f(z)). The residue is implemented in the Wolfram Language as Residue[f, {z, z0}].
p284
aVA composite number n is a positive integer n>1 which is not prime (i.e., which has factors other than 1 and itself). The first few composite numbers (sometimes called "composites" for short) are 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, ... (OEIS A002808), whose prime decompositions are summarized in the following table. Note that the number 1 is a special case which is considered to be neither composite nor prime.
p285
aVThe nesting of two or more functions to form a single new function is known as composition. The composition of two functions f and g is denoted f°g, where f is a function whose domain includes the range of g. The notation\u000a(f°g)(x) = f(g(x)), is sometimes used to explicitly indicate the variable.\u000aComposition is associative, so that\u000af°(g°h) = (f°g)°h.\u000aIf the functions g is continuous at x_0 and f is continuous at g(x_0), then f°g is also continuous at x_0.

aVLet P be the principal (initial investment), r be the annual compounded rate, i^(n) the "nominal rate, " n be the number of times interest is compounded per year (i.e., the year is divided into n conversion periods), and t be the number of years (the "term"). The interest rate per conversion period is then\u000ar congruent i^(n)/n.

aVA concave polygon is a polygon that is not convex.\u000aA simple polygon is concave iff at least one of its internal angles is greater than 180°. An example of a non-simple (self-intersecting) polygon is a star polygon.\u000aA concave polygon must have at least four sides.
p289
aVConcentric circles are circles with a common center. The region between two concentric circles of different radii is called an annulus. Any two circles can be made concentric by inversion by picking the inversion center as one of the limiting points.\u000aGiven two concentric circles with radii R and 2R, what is the probability that a chord chosen at random from the outer circle will cut across the inner circle? Depending on how the "random" chord is chosen, 1/2, 1/3, or 1/4 could all be correct answers.
p290
aVTwo or more lines are said to be concurrent if they intersect in a single point. Two lines concur if their trilinear coordinates satisfy\u000a left bracketing bar l_1 | m_1 | n_1\u000al_2 | m_2 | n_2\u000al_3 | m_3 | n_3 right bracketing bar = 0.
p291
aVFour or more points P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, ... which lie on a circle C are said to be concyclic. Three points are trivially concyclic since three noncollinear points determine a circle (i.e., every triangle has a circumcircle). Ptolemy's theorem can be used to determine if four points are concyclic.\u000aThe number of the n^2 lattice points x, y element [1, n] which can be picked with no four concyclic is o(n^(2/3) - \u03f5).\u000aA theorem states that if any four consecutive points of a polygon are not concyclic, then its area can be increased by making them concyclic. This fact arises in some proofs that the solution to the isoperimetric problem is the circle.
p292
aVThe conditional probability of an event A assuming that B has occurred, denoted P(A|B), equals\u000aP(A|B) = (P(A intersection B))/(P(B)), which can be proven directly using a Venn diagram. Multiplying through, this becomes\u000aP(A|B) P(B) = P(A intersection B), which can be generalized to\u000aP(A intersection B intersection C) = P(A) P(B|A) P(C|A intersection B).
p293
aVIn general, a cone is a pyramid with a circular cross section. A right cone is a cone with its vertex above the center of its base. However, when used without qualification, the term "cone" often means "right cone."\u000aIn discussions of conic sections, the word "cone" is taken to mean "double cone, " i.e., two cones placed apex to apex. The double cone is a quadratic surface, and each single cone is called a "nappe." The hyperbola can then be defined as the intersection of a plane with both nappes of the cone.\u000aCones are implemented in the Wolfram Language as Cone[{{x1, y1, z1}, {x2, y2, z2}}, r].
p294
aVThe mapping of a grid of regularly ruled squares onto a cone with no overlap or misalignment. Cone nets are possible for vertex angles of 90°, 180°, and 270°, where the dark edges in the upper diagrams above are joined. Beautiful photographs of cone net models (lower diagrams above) are presented in Steinhaus. The transformation from a point (x, y) in the grid plane to a point (x', y', z') on the cone is given by

aVA set X is called a "cone" with vertex at the origin if for any x element X and any scalar a>=0, ax element X.
p296
aVA confidence interval is an interval in which a measurement or trial falls corresponding to a given probability. Usually, the confidence interval of interest is symmetrically placed around the mean, so a 50% confidence interval for a symmetric probability density function would be the interval [-a, a] such that\u000a1/2 = integral_(-a)^a P(x) dx.
p297
aVThe word configuration is sometimes used to describe a finite collection of points p = (p_1, ..., p_n), p_i element R^d, where R^d is a Euclidean space.\u000aThe term "configuration" also is used to describe a finite incidence structure (v_r, b_k) with the following properties.
p298
aVA conformal mapping, also called a conformal map, conformal transformation, angle-preserving transformation, or biholomorphic map, is a transformation w = f(z) that preserves local angles. An analytic function is conformal at any point where it has a nonzero derivative. Conversely, any conformal mapping of a complex variable which has continuous partial derivatives is analytic. Conformal mapping is extremely important in complex analysis, as well as in many areas of physics and engineering.\u000aA mapping that preserves the magnitude of angles, but not their orientation is called an isogonal mapping.
p299
aVIf two numbers b and c have the property that their difference b - c is integrally divisible by a number m (i.e., (b - c)/m is an integer), then b and c are said to be "congruent modulo m." The number m is called the modulus, and the statement "b is congruent to c (modulo m)" is written mathematically as\u000ab congruent c (mod m).\u000aIf b - c is not integrally divisible by m, then it is said that "b is not congruent to c (modulo m), " which is written\u000ab not congruent c (mod m).
p300
aVA congruent number can be defined as an integer that is equal to the area of a rational right triangle.\u000aNumbers (a, x, y, z, t) such that\u000a{x^2 + ay^2 = z^2\u000ax^2 - ay^2 = t^2 auto right match \u000aare also known as congruent numbers. They are a generalization of the congruum problem, which is the case y = 1.
p301
aVA conical frustum is a frustum created by slicing the top off a cone (with the cut made parallel to the base). For a right circular cone, let s be the slant height and R_1 and R_2 the base and top radii. Then\u000as = sqrt((R_1 - R_2)^2 + h^2).\u000aThe surface area, not including the top and bottom circles, is\u000aA | = | \u03c0(R_1 + R_2) s\u000a | = | \u03c0(R_1 + R_2) sqrt((R_1 - R_2)^2 + h^2).
p302
aVThe conic sections are the nondegenerate curves generated by the intersections of a plane with one or two nappes of a cone. For a plane perpendicular to the axis of the cone, a circle is produced. For a plane that is not perpendicular to the axis and that intersects only a single nappe, the curve produced is either an ellipse or a parabola. The curve produced by a plane intersecting both nappes is a hyperbola (Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen 1999, pp. 8-9).\u000aThe ellipse and hyperbola are known as central conics.
p303
aVThe directrix of a conic section is the line which, together with the point known as the focus, serves to define a conic section as the locus of points whose distance from the focus is proportional to the horizontal distance from the directrix, with r being the constant of proportionality. If the ratio r = 1, the conic is a parabola, if r<1, it is an ellipse, and if r>1, it is a hyperbola.\u000aHyperbolas and noncircular ellipses have two distinct foci and two associated directrices, each directrix being perpendicular to the line joining the two foci.
p304
aVA topological space decomposes into its connected components. The connectedness relation between two pairs of points satisfies transitivity, i.e., if a~b and b~c then a~c. Hence, being in the same component is an equivalence relation, and the equivalence classes are the connected components.\u000aUsing pathwise-connectedness, the pathwise-connected component containing x element X is the set of all y pathwise-connected to x. That is, it is the set of y such that there is a continuous path from x to y.
p305
aVA graph which is connected in the sense of a topological space, i.e., there is a path from any point to any other point in the graph. A graph that is not connected is said to be disconnected. This definition means that the null graph and singleton graph are considered connected, while empty graphs on n>=2 nodes are disconnected. The number of n-node connected unlabeled graphs for n = 1, 2, ... are 1, 1, 2, 6, 21, 112, 853, 11117, 261080, ... (OEIS A001349). The total number of (not necessarily connected) unlabeled n-node graphs is given by the Euler transform of the preceding sequence, 1, 2, 4, 11, 34, 156, 1044, 12346, ... (OEIS A000088, p. 20).

aVA constant, sometimes also called a "mathematical constant, " is any well-defined real number which is significantly interesting in some way. In this work, the term "constant" is generally reserved for real nonintegral numbers of interest, while "number" is used to refer to interesting integers (e.g., Brun's constant, but beast number). However, in contexts such as linear combination, the term "constant" is generally used to mean "scalar" or "real number, " and need not exclude integer values.\u000aA function, equation, etc., is said to "be constant" (or be a constant function) if it always assumes the same value independent of how its parameters are varied.

aVCompass and straightedge geometric constructions dating back to Euclid were capable of inscribing regular polygons of 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, 30, 32, 40, 48, 60, 64, ..., sides. In 1796 (when he was 19 years old), Gauss gave a sufficient condition for a regular n-gon to be constructible, which he also conjectured (but did not prove) to be necessary, thus showing that regular n-gons were constructible for n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 20, 24, 30, 32, 34, 40, 48, 51, 60, 64, ... (OEIS A003401).\u000aA complete enumeration of "constructible" polygons is given by those with central angles corresponding to so-called trigonometry angles.

aVThe contact triangle of a triangle \u0394ABC, also called the intouch triangle, is the triangle \u0394C_A C_B C_C formed by the points of tangency of the incircle of \u0394ABC with \u0394ABC.\u000aThe contact triangle is therefore the pedal triangle of \u0394ABC with respect to the incenter I of \u0394ABC. It is also the Cevian triangle of \u0394ABC with respect to the Gergonne point Ge and the cyclocevian triangle with respect to the same point.\u000aThe contact triangle is the polar triangle of the incircle.

aVThere are several meanings of the word content in mathematics.\u000aThe content of a polytope or other n-dimensional object is its generalized volume (i.e., its "hypervolume"). Just as a three-dimensional object has volume, surface area, and generalized diameter, an n-dimensional object has "measures" of order 1, 2, ..., n. The content of a region can be computed in the Wolfram Language using RegionMeasure[reg].

aVThe term "continued fraction" can be applied in several different contexts. In general, any expression \u03be of the form\u000a\u03be = b_0 + a_1/(b_1 + a_2/(b_2 + a_3/(b_3 + ...)))\u000awith terms a_j, b_k, j = 1, 2, 3, ..., k = 0, 1, 2, ..., consisting of arbitrary mathematical objects such as vectors in C^n, C-valued square matrices, Hilbert space operators, multivariate expressions, other such fractions, etc., is a continued fraction. Such expressions can terminate after finitely many terms or can continued infinitely. The terms a_k, respectively b_k, are called the partial numerators, respectively partial denominators, of \u03be, and together, objects of the collection {a_k, b_k} are called the elements of \u03be.\u000aMost typically, the term "continued fraction" is used to describe the scenario where a_j and b_k, j = 1, 2, 3..., k = 0, 1, 2, ..., are integers. In this case, any continued fraction which terminates after a finite number of terms defines a rational number q element Q. Otherwise, there are two distinct possibilities for the expression \u03be which are characterized by the behavior of the rational numbers q_n defined by the finite expressions \u03be_n of the form\u000a\u03be_n = b_0 + a_1/(b_1 + a_2/( \u22f1 + a_n/b_n)), called the nth convergent of \u03be. In particular, it may be the case that for some real number \u03b1 element R, \u03be_n ->\u03b1 as n->\u221e whereby it is said that \u03be is the continued fraction associated to \u03b1 and that \u03be_n converges to \u03b1; it is also possible, however, that \u03be_n diverges as a sequence of rational numbers.\u000aThe above definition can be made both more general and more mathematically rigorous by way of the following function-theoretic construction. Given an ordered pair of sequences ({a_m}, {b_m}), a_m, b_m element C, m element Z^+, a_m !=0 for m>=1, one may consider the associated sequences {s_n(w)}, {S_n(w)}, n = 0, 1, 2, ..., of linear fractional transformations defined recursively by s_0(w) = b_0 + w, s_n(w) = a_n/(b_n + w), S_0(w) = s_0(w), S_n(w) = S_(n - 1)(s_n(w)) for n = 1, 2, 3, .... By then defining the sequence {f_n} so that, for each n = 0, 1, 2, ..., f_n = S_n(0) element C union {\u221e}, one can define a continued fraction (with complex elements) to be the ordered pair (({a_m}, {b_m}), {f_n}).

aVThere are several commonly used methods of defining the slippery, but extremely important, concept of a continuous function (which, depending on context, may also be called a continuous map). The space of continuous functions is denoted C^0, and corresponds to the k = 0 case of a C^k function.\u000aA continuous function can be formally defined as a function f:X->Y where the pre-image of every open set in Y is open in X.

aVThe term "continuum" has (at least) two distinct technical meanings in mathematics.\u000aThe first is a compact connected metric space (Kuratowski 1968; Lewis 1983, pp. 361-394; Nadler 1992; Prajs and Charatonik).\u000aThe second is the nondenumerable set of real numbers, denoted c.

aVContour integration is the process of calculating the values of a contour integral around a given contour in the complex plane. As a result of a truly amazing property of holomorphic functions, such integrals can be computed easily simply by summing the values of the complex residues inside the contour.\u000aLet P(x) and Q(x) be polynomials of polynomial degree n and m with coefficients b_n, ..., b_0 and c_m, ..., c_0. Take the contour in the upper half-plane, replace x by z, and write z congruent Re^(i\u03b8). Then\u000a integral_(-\u221e)^\u221e (P(z) dz)/(Q(z)) = lim_(R->\u221e) integral_(-R)^R (P(z) dz)/(Q(z)).
p316
aVThe winding number of a contour \u03b3 about a point z_0, denoted n(\u03b3, z_0), is defined by\u000an(\u03b3, z_0) = 1/(2\u03c0i)\u222e_\u03b3 (dz)/(z - z_0)\u000aand gives the number of times \u03b3 curve passes (counterclockwise) around a point. Counterclockwise winding is assigned a positive winding number, while clockwise winding is assigned a negative winding number. The winding number is also called the index, and denoted Ind_\u03b3(z_0).

aVThe word "convergent" has a number of different meanings in mathematics.\u000aMost commonly, it is an adjective used to describe a convergent sequence or convergent series, where it essentially means that the respective series or sequence approaches some limit.\u000aThe rational number obtained by keeping only a limited number of terms in a continued fraction is also called a convergent.
p319
aVA sequence is said to be convergent if it approaches some limit.\u000aFormally, a sequence S_n converges to the limit S\u000alim_(n->\u221e) S_n = S\u000aif, for any \u03f5>0, there exists an N such that left bracketing bar S_n - S right bracketing bar <\u03f5 for n>N. If S_n does not converge, it is said to diverge. This condition can also be written as\u000a(lim_(n->\u221e))^_ S_n = lim_(n->\u221e)__ S_n = S.\u000aEvery bounded monotonic sequence converges. Every unbounded sequence diverges.

aVA convex function is a continuous function whose value at the midpoint of every interval in its domain does not exceed the arithmetic mean of its values at the ends of the interval.\u000aMore generally, a function f(x) is convex on an interval [a, b] if for any two points x_1 and x_2 in [a, b] and any \u03bb where 0<\u03bb<1, f[\u03bbx_1 + (1 - \u03bb) x_2]<=\u03bbf(x_1) + (1 - \u03bb) f(x_2)\u000a(Rudin 1976, p. 101; cf. Gradshteyn and Ryzhik 2000, p. 1132).

aVThe convex hull of a set of points S in n dimensions is the intersection of all convex sets containing S. For N points p_1, ..., p_N, the convex hull C is then given by the expression\u000aC congruent { sum_(j = 1)^N \u03bb_j p_j :\u03bb_j >=0 for all j and sum_(j = 1)^N \u03bb_j = 1}.

aVA planar polygon is convex if it contains all the line segments connecting any pair of its points. Thus, for example, a regular pentagon is convex, while an indented pentagon is not. A planar polygon that is not convex is said to be a concave polygon.

aVA convolution is an integral that expresses the amount of overlap of one function g as it is shifted over another function f. It therefore "blends" one function with another. For example, in synthesis imaging, the measured dirty map is a convolution of the "true" CLEAN map with the dirty beam (the Fourier transform of the sampling distribution). The convolution is sometimes also known by its German name, faltung ("folding").\u000aConvolution is implemented in the Wolfram Language as Convolve[f, g, x, y] and DiscreteConvolve[f, g, n, m].

aVLet a, b, and c be the side lengths of a reference triangle \u0394ABC. Now let A_b be a point on the extension of the segment CA beyond A such that AA_b = a. Similarly, define the points A_c, B_c, B_a, C_a, C_b so that the points A_c and B_c lie on the extended segment AB, the points B_a and C_a lie on the extended segment BC, and the point C_b lies on the extended segment CA, and we have AA_c = a, BB_c = b, BB_a = b, CC_a = c and CC_b = c.\u000aThen the points A_b, A_c, B_c, B_a, C_a, and C_b are concyclic and the resulting circle is known as Conway circle of \u0394ABC.

aVConway games were introduced by J. H. Conway in 1976 to provide a formal structure for analyzing games satisfying certain requirements: \u000a1. There are two players, Left and Right (L and R), who move alternately. \u000a2. The first player unable to move loses. \u000a3. Both players have complete information about the state of the game. \u000a4. There is no element of chance. \u000aFor example, nim is a Conway game, but chess is not (due to the possibility of draws and stalemate). Note that Conway's "game of life" is (somewhat confusingly) not a Conway game.

aVA coordinate chart is a way of expressing the points of a small neighborhood, usually on a manifold M, as coordinates in Euclidean space. An example from geography is the coordinate chart given by the functions of latitude and longitude. This coordinate chart is not valid on the whole globe, since it doesn't give unique coordinates at the north or south pole (which way is east from the north pole?).

There is an infinite family of such shapes.\u000aThe shape with smallest volume has triangular cross sections.\u000aThe plug with the largest volume is made using two cuts from the top diameter to the edge, as illustrated above. Such a plug has h = 2r to obtain a square cross section. For a general such a plug of height h and radius r, the volume of the plug is\u000aV = 1/3(3\u03c0 - 4) hr^2 .

aVA plot in the complex plane of the points\u000aB(t) = S(t) + iC(t), where S(t) and C(t) are the Fresnel integrals. The Cornu spiral is also known as the clothoid or Euler's spiral. It was probably first studied by Johann Bernoulli around 1696. A Cornu spiral describes diffraction from the edge of a half-plane.\u000aThe quantities C(t)/S(t) and S(t)/C(t) are plotted above. \u000aThe slope of the curve's tangent vector (above right figure) is\u000am_T(t) = (S'(t))/(C'(t)) = tan(1/2 \u03c0t^2), plotted below.

aVCorrelation is the degree to which two or more quantities are linearly associated. In a two-dimensional plot, the degree of correlation between the values on the two axes is quantified by the so-called correlation coefficient.\u000aCorrelating values of a variable X with corresponding values at a different time is called autocorrelation.

aVThe correlation coefficient, sometimes also called the cross-correlation coefficient, is a quantity that gives the quality of a least squares fitting to the original data. To define the correlation coefficient, first consider the sum of squared values ss_(xx), ss_(xy), and ss_(yy) of a set of n data points (x_i, y_i) about their respective means,

aVThe cosine function cosx is one of the basic functions encountered in trigonometry (the others being the cosecant, cotangent, secant, sine, and tangent). Let \u03b8 be an angle measured counterclockwise from the x-axis along the arc of the unit circle. Then cos\u03b8 is the horizontal coordinate of the arc endpoint.\u000aThe common schoolbook definition of the cosine of an angle \u03b8 in a right triangle (which is equivalent to the definition just given) is as the ratio of the lengths of the side of the triangle adjacent to the angle and the hypotenuse, i.e., cos\u03b8 = adjacenct/hypotenuse.

aVDraw antiparallels through the symmedian point K. The points where these lines intersect the sides then lie on a circle, known as the cosine circle (or sometimes the second Lemoine circle). The chords Q_2 P_3, Q_3 P_1, and Q_1 P_2 are proportional to the cosines of the angles of \u0394A_1 A_2 A_3, giving the circle its name. In fact, there are infinitely many circles that cut the side line chords in the same proportions. The centers of these circles lie on the Stammler hyperbola (Ehrmann and van Lamoen 2002).\u000aThe cosine circle is a special case of a Tucker circle with \u03bb = 0.

aVThe Costa surface is a complete minimal embedded surface of finite topology (i.e., it has no boundary and does not intersect itself). It has genus 1 with three punctures. Until this surface was discovered by Costa, the only other known complete minimal embeddable surfaces in R^3 with no self-intersections were the plane (genus 0), catenoid (genus 0 with two punctures), and helicoid (genus 0 with two punctures), and it was conjectured that these were the only such surfaces.\u000aRather amazingly, the Costa surface belongs to the D_4 dihedral group of symmetries.

aVCovariance provides a measure of the strength of the correlation between two or more sets of random variates. The covariance for two random variates X and Y, each with sample size N, is defined by the expectation value\u000acov(X, Y) | = | \u2329(X - \u03bc_X)(Y - \u03bc_Y)\u232a\u000a | = | \u2329XY\u232a - \u03bc_X \u03bc_y\u000awhere \u03bc_x = \u2329X\u232a and \u03bc_y = \u2329Y\u232a are the respective means, which can be written out explicitly as\u000acov(X, Y) = sum_(i = 1)^N ((x_i - x^_)(y_i - y^_))/N.

Higher order matrices are given by\u000aV_(ij)^(mn) = \u2329(x_i - \u03bc_i)^m (x_j - \u03bc_j)^n\u232a.\u000aAn individual matrix element V_(ij) = cov(x_i, x_j) is called the covariance of x_i and x_j.

aVA game played with two dice. If the total is 7 or 11 (a "natural"), the thrower wins and retains the dice for another throw. If the total is 2, 3, or 12 ("craps"), the thrower loses but retains the dice. If the total is any other number (called the thrower's "point"), the thrower must continue throwing and roll the "point" value again before throwing a 7. If he succeeds, he wins and retains the dice, but if a 7 appears first, the player loses and passes the dice.\u000aThe following table summarizes the probabilities of winning on a roll-by-roll basis, where P(p = n) is the probability of rolling a point n.

aVThe line \u211c[s] = 1/2 in the complex plane on which the Riemann hypothesis asserts that all nontrivial (complex) Riemann zeta function zeros lie. The plot above shows the first few zeros of the Riemann zeta function, with the critical line shown in red. The zeros with \u2111[s] = 0 and \u211c[s]<0 that do not line on the critical line are the trivial zeros of \u03b6(s) at s = - 2, -4, .... Although it is known that an infinite number of zeros lie on the critical line and that these comprise at least 40% of all zeros, the Riemann hypothesis is still unproven.

aVThe self-intersection of a one-sided surface. The word "cross-cap" is sometimes also written without the hyphen as the single word "crosscap." The cross-cap can be thought of as the object produced by puncturing a surface a single time, attaching two zips around the puncture in the same direction, distorting the hole so that the zips line up, requiring that the surface intersect itself, and then zipping up. The cross-cap can also be described as a circular hole which, when entered, exits from its opposite point (from a topological viewpoint, both singular points on the cross-cap are equivalent).\u000aThe cross-cap has a segment of double points which terminates at two "pinch points." A cross-handle is homeomorphic to two cross-caps.

aVThe cross polytope \u03b2_n is the regular polytope in n dimensions corresponding to the convex hull of the points formed by permuting the coordinates ( ± 1, 0, 0, ..., 0). A cross-polytope (also called an orthoplex) is denoted \u03b2_n and has 2n vertices and Schläfli symbol {3, ..., 3_\ufe38_(n - 2), 4}. The cross polytope is named because its 2n vertices are located equidistant from the origin along the Cartesian axes in Euclidean space, which each such axis perpendicular to all others. A cross polytope is bounded by 2^n (n - 1)-simplexes, and is a dipyramid erected (in both directions) into the nth dimension, with an (n - 1)-dimensional cross polytope as its base.\u000aIn one dimension, the cross polytope is the line segment [-1, 1]. In two dimensions, the cross polytope {4} is the filled square with vertices (-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, 0), (0, 1). In three dimensions, the cross polytope {3, 4} is the convex hull of the octahedron with vertices (-1, 0, 0), (0, -1, 0), (0, 0, -1), (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1). In four dimensions, the cross polytope {3, 3, 4} is the 16-cell, depicted in the above figure by projecting onto one of the four mutually perpendicular three-spaces within the four-space obtained by dropping one of the four vertex components (R. Towle).\u000aThe skeleton of \u03b2_n is isomorphic with the circulant graph Ci_(2n)(1, 2, ..., n - 1), also known as the n-cocktail party graph.\u000aFor all dimensions, the dual of the cross polytope is the hypercube (and vice versa). Consequently, the number of k-simplices contained in an n-cross polytope is (n\u000ak + 1)2^(k + 1).

aVA cross section of a solid is a plane figure obtained by the intersection of that solid with a plane. The cross section of an object therefore represents an infinitesimal "slice" of a solid, and may be different depending on the orientation of the slicing plane. While the cross section of a sphere is always a disk, the cross section of a cube may be a square, hexagon, or other shape.

aVThe cube is the Platonic solid P_1 (also called the regular hexahedron). It is composed of six square faces that meet each other at right angles and has eight vertices and 12 edges. It is also the uniform polyhedron U_6 and Wenninger model W_3. It is described by the Schläfli symbol {4, 3} and Wythoff symbol 3|24.\u000aThe cube is illustrated above, together with a wireframe version and a net (top figures). The bottom figures show three symmetric projections of the cube.

aVA polyhedron compound of two cubes. The compound at left (also called the double cube) is obtained by allowing two cubes to share opposite polyhedron vertices, then rotating one a sixth of a turn about a C_3 axis. The compound at right combines two cubes, one rotated 45° with respect to the other along a C_4 axis, producing an octagrammic prism.\u000aThe C_3 compound appears twice (in the lower left as a beveled wireframe and in the lower center as a solid) as polyhedral "stars" in M. C. Escher's 1948 wood engraving "Stars" (Forty 2003, Plate 43).
p361
aVA compound also called Bakos' compound having the symmetry of the cube which arises by joining four cubes such that each C_3 axis falls along the C_3 axis of one of the other cubes. Let the first cube c_1 consists of a cube in standard position rotated by \u03c0/3 radians around the (1, 1, 1)-axis, then the other three cubes are obtained by rotating c_1 around the (0, 0, 1)-axis (z-axis) by \u03c0/2, -\u03c0/2, and \u03c0 radians, respectively. The illustration at right above shows a paper sculpture of the cube 4-compound.\u000aThe net of the cube 4-compound is illustrated above for cubes with unit edges lengths.

aVA cubic curve is an algebraic curve of curve order 3. An algebraic curve over a field K is an equation f(X, Y) = 0, where f(X, Y) is a polynomial in X and Y with coefficients in K, and the degree of f is the maximum degree of each of its terms (monomials).\u000aExamples include the cissoid of Diocles, conchoid of de Sluze, folium of Descartes, Maclaurin trisectrix, Maltese cross curve, right strophoid, semicubical parabola, serpentine curve, Tschirnhausen cubic, and witch of Agnesi, as well as elliptic curves such as the Mordell curve and Ochoa curve.
p366
aVA cubic equation is an equation involving a cubic polynomial, i.e., one of the form\u000aa_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0.\u000aSince a_3 !=0 (or else the polynomial would be quadratic and not cubic), this can without loss of generality be divided through by a_3, giving\u000ax^3 + a_2^, x^2 + a_1^, x + a_0^, = 0.\u000aA closed-form formula known as the cubic formula exists for the solutions of a cubic equation.
p367
aVCubic graphs, also called trivalent graphs, are graphs all of whose nodes have degree 3 (i.e., 3-regular graphs). Cubic graphs on n nodes exists only for even n. Not-necessarily-connected cubic graphs on n = 4, 6, and 8 are illustrated above. An enumeration of cubic graphs on n nodes for small n is implemented in the Wolfram Language as GraphData[Cubic, n].\u000aA necessary (but not sufficient) criterion for a graph to be cubic is that m/n = 3/2, where m is the edge count and n is the vertex count.
p368
aVA cubic lattice is a lattice whose points lie at positions (x, y, z) in the Cartesian three-space, where x, y, and z are integers.\u000aThe term is also used to refer to a regular arrangement of spheres whose unit cell form a cube. There are three types of cubic lattices, corresponding to three types of cubic close packing: simple cubic (SC), body-centered cubic (BCC), and face-centered cubic (FCC). The illustrations above show the Brillouin zones for these types of lattice.
p369
aVA cubic number is a figurate number of the form n^3 with n a positive integer. The first few are 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, ... (OEIS A000578). The protagonist Christopher in the novel The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time recites the cubic numbers to calm himself and prevent himself from wanting to hit someone.\u000aThe generating function giving the cubic numbers is\u000a(x(x^2 + 4x + 1))/(x - 1)^4 = x + 8x^2 + 27x^3 + ....\u000aThe hex pyramidal numbers are equivalent to the cubic numbers.
p370
aVA cubic polynomial is a polynomial of degree 3. A univariate cubic polynomial has the form f(x) = a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0. An equation involving a cubic polynomial is called a cubic equation. A closed-form solution known as the cubic formula exists for the solutions of an arbitrary cubic equation.
p371
aVA cubic spline is a spline constructed of piecewise third-order polynomials which pass through a set of m control points. The second derivative of each polynomial is commonly set to zero at the endpoints, since this provides a boundary condition that completes the system of m - 2 equations. This produces a so-called "natural" cubic spline and leads to a simple tridiagonal system which can be solved easily to give the coefficients of the polynomials. However, this choice is not the only one possible, and other boundary conditions can be used instead.\u000aCubic splines are implemented in the Wolfram Language as BSplineCurve[pts, SplineDegree -> 3].
p372
aVAn algebraic surface of order 3. Schläfli and Cayley classified the singular cubic surfaces. On the general cubic, there exists a curious geometrical structure called double sixes, and also a particular arrangement of 27 (possibly complex) lines, as discovered by Schläfli and sometimes called Solomon's seal lines. A nonregular cubic surface can contain 3, 7, 15, or 27 real lines (Segre 1942, Le Lionnais 1983). The Clebsch diagonal cubic contains all possible 27. The maximum number of ordinary double points on a cubic surface is four, and the unique cubic surface having four ordinary double points is the Cayley cubic.
p373
aVA cubic symmetric graph is a symmetric cubic (i.e., regular of order 3). Such graphs were first studied by Foster. They have since been the subject of much interest and study. Since cubic graphs must have an even number of vertices, so must cubic symmetric graphs.

aVA cuboctahedron, also called the heptaparallelohedron or dymaxion (the latter according to Buckminster Fuller; Rawles 1997), is Archimedean solid A_1 with faces 8{3} + 6{4}. It is one of the two convex quasiregular polyhedra. It is uniform polyhedron U_7 and Wenninger model W_11. It has Schläfli symbol {3\u000a4} and Wythoff symbol 2|34.\u000aA cuboctahedron appears in the lower left as one of the polyhedral "stars" in M. C. Escher's 1948 wood engraving "Stars" (Forty 2003, Plate 43), as well is in the mezzotint "Crystal" .
p375
aVA closed box composed of three pairs of rectangular faces placed opposite each other and joined at right angles to each other, also known as a rectangular parallelepiped. The cuboid is also a right prism, a special case of the parallelepiped, and corresponds to what in everyday parlance is known as a (rectangular) "box." Cuboids are implemented in the Wolfram Language as Cuboid[{xmin, ymin, zmin}, {xmax, ymax, zmax}] by giving the coordinates of opposite corners. The monolith with side lengths 1, 4, and 9 in the book and film version 2001: A Space Odyssey is an example of a cuboid.

aVCumulation is the dual operation of truncation which replaces the faces of a polyhedron with pyramids of height h (where h may be positive, zero, or negative) having the face as the base. This operation is implemented under the misnomer Stellate[poly, ratio] in the Wolfram Language package PolyhedronOperations \u0300 . The operation is sometimes also called accretion, augmentation (Cromwell 1997, p. 124 and 195-197), or akisation (since it transforms a regular polygon to an n-akis polyhedron, i.e., quadruples the number of faces).\u000aMineralogists give the following special names to cumulated forms of regular solids.

aVA cumulative product is a sequence of partial products of a given sequence. For example, the cumulative products of the sequence {a, b, c, ...}, are a, ab, abc, .... Cumulative products can be implemented in the Wolfram Language as \u000a Rest[FoldList[Times, 1, list]]

aVThe curl of a vector field, denoted curl(F) or del xF (the notation used in this work), is defined as the vector field having magnitude equal to the maximum "circulation" at each point and to be oriented perpendicularly to this plane of circulation for each point. More precisely, the magnitude of del xF is the limiting value of circulation per unit area. Written explicitly, ( del xF)·n^^ congruent lim_(A->0) (\u222e_C F·ds)/A,

aVThe curlicue fractal is a figure obtained by the following procedure. Let s be an irrational number. Begin with a line segment of unit length, which makes an angle \u03d5_0 congruent 0 to the horizontal. Then define \u03b8_n iteratively by\u000a\u03b8_(n + 1) = (\u03b8_n + 2\u03c0s) (mod 2\u03c0), with \u03b8_0 = 0.
p383
aVIn general, there are two important types of curvature: extrinsic curvature and intrinsic curvature. The extrinsic curvature of curves in two- and three-space was the first type of curvature to be studied historically, culminating in the Frenet formulas, which describe a space curve entirely in terms of its "curvature, " torsion, and the initial starting point and direction.
p384
aVThere are no fewer than three distinct notions of curve throughout mathematics.\u000aIn topology, a curve is a one-dimensional continuum.\u000aIn algebraic geometry, an algebraic curve over a field K is the zero locus of some polynomial f(X, Y) of two variables which has its coefficients in K.\u000aIn analytic geometry, a curve is continuous map from a one-dimensional space to an n-dimensional space. Loosely speaking, the word "curve" is often used to mean the function graph of a two- or three-dimensional curve.
p385
aVA cycle graph C_n, sometimes simply known as an n-cycle, is a graph on n nodes containing a single cycle through all nodes.\u000aCycle graphs can be generated in the Wolfram Language using CycleGraph[n]. Precomputed properties are available using GraphData[{Cycle, n}]. A graph may be tested to see if it is a cycle graph using PathGraphQ[g] && Not[AcyclicGraphQ[g]], where the second check is needed since the Wolfram Language believes cycle graphs are also path graphs (a convention which seems nonstandard at best).
p386
aVA cyclic group is a group that can be generated by a single element X (the group generator). Cyclic groups are Abelian.\u000aA cyclic group of finite group order n is denoted C_n, Z_n, Z_n, or C_n; Shanks 1993, p. 75), and its generator X satisfies\u000aX^n = I, where I is the identity element.\u000aThe ring of integers Z form an infinite cyclic group under addition, and the integers 0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1 (Z_n) form a cyclic group of order n under addition (mod n). In both cases, 0 is the identity element.
p387
aVC_4 is one of the two groups of group order 4. Like C_2×C_2, it is Abelian, but unlike C_2×C_2, it is a cyclic. Examples include the point groups C_4 (note that the same notation is used for the abstract cyclic group C_n and the point group isomorphic to it) and S_4, the integers modulo 4 under addition (Z_4), and the modulo multiplication groups M_5 and M_10 (which are the only two modulo multiplication groups isomorphic to it).\u000aThe cycle graph of C_4 is shown above, and the cycle index is given by\u000aZ(C_4) = 1/4 x_1^4 + 1/4 x_2^2 + 1/2 x_4 .
p388
aVA cyclic number is an (n - 1)-digit integer that, when multiplied by 1, 2, 3, ..., n - 1, produces the same digits in a different order. Cyclic numbers are generated by the full reptend primes, i.e., 7, 17, 19, 23, 29, 47, 59, 61, 97, ... (OEIS A001913).
p389
aVA cyclic quadrilateral is a quadrilateral for which a circle can be circumscribed so that it touches each polygon vertex. A quadrilateral that can be both inscribed and circumscribed on some pair of circles is known as a bicentric quadrilateral.\u000aThe area of a cyclic quadrilateral is the maximum possible for any quadrilateral with the given side lengths. The opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral sum to \u03c0 radians (Euclid, Book III, Proposition 22; Heath 1956; Dunham 1990, p. 121). There exists a closed billiards path inside a cyclic quadrilateral if its circumcenter lies inside the quadrilateral.
p390
aVA tag system in which a list of n tag rules (each of a special form) is applied to a system in sequential order and then starting again from the first rule. In a cyclic tag system, each set of tag rules has the special structure that a pattern is appended if (and only if) the first element of the current pattern is a 1 and that independent of whether the first element is 0 or 1, the first element is then deleted.
p391
aVA cyclide is a pair of focal conics which are the envelopes of two one-parameter families of spheres, sometimes also called a cyclid. The cyclide is a quartic surface, and the lines of curvature on a cyclide are all straight lines or circular arcs. The standard tori and their inversions in an inversion sphere S centered at a point x_0 and of radius r, given by\u000aI(x_0, r) = x_0 + ((x - x_0) r^2)/( left bracketing bar x - x_0 right bracketing bar )^2,

aVThe cycloid is the locus of a point on the rim of a circle of radius a rolling along a straight line. It was studied and named by Galileo in 1599. Galileo attempted to find the area by weighing pieces of metal cut into the shape of the cycloid. Torricelli, Fermat, and Descartes all found the area. The cycloid was also studied by Roberval in 1634, Wren in 1658, Huygens in 1673, and Johann Bernoulli in 1696. Roberval and Wren found the arc length (MacTutor Archive). Gear teeth were also made out of cycloids, as first proposed by Desargues in the 1630s.
p393
aVThe involute of the cycloid\u000ax | = | a(t - sint)\u000ay | = | a(1 - cost)\u000ais given by\u000ax_i | = | a(t + sint)\u000ay_i | = | a(3 + cost).\u000aAs can be seen in the above figure, the involute is simply a shifted copy of the original cycloid, so the cycloid is its own involute!
p394
aVA polynomial given by\u000a\u03a6_n(x) = product_(k = 1)^n'(x - \u03b6_k), where \u03b6_k are the roots of unity in C given by\u000a\u03b6_k congruent e^(2\u03c0ik/n)\u000aand k runs over integers relatively prime to n. The prime may be dropped if the product is instead taken over primitive roots of unity, so that\u000a\u03a6_n(x) = product_k = 1\u000aprimitive \u03b6_k^n(x - \u03b6_k).
p395
aVThe term "cylinder" has a number of related meanings. In its most general usage, the word "cylinder" refers to a solid bounded by a closed generalized cylinder (a.k.a. cylindrical surface) and two parallel planes. A cylinder of this sort having a polygonal base is therefore a prism. Harris and Stocker use the term "general cylinder" to refer to the solid bounded a closed generalized cylinder.\u000aUnfortunately, the term "cylinder" is commonly used not only to refer to the solid bounded by a cylindrical surface, but to the cylindrical surface itself. To make matters worse, according to topologists, a cylindrical surface is not even a true surface, but rather a so-called surface with boundary.
p396
aVCylindrical coordinates are a generalization of two-dimensional polar coordinates to three dimensions by superposing a height (z) axis. Unfortunately, there are a number of different notations used for the other two coordinates. Either r or \u03c1 is used to refer to the radial coordinate and either \u03d5 or \u03b8 to the azimuthal coordinates. Arfken, for instance, uses (\u03c1, \u03d5, z), while Beyer uses (r, \u03b8, z). In this work, the notation (r, \u03b8, z) is used.\u000aThe following table summarizes notational conventions used by a number of authors.
p397
aVA cylindrical segment, sometimes also called a truncated cylinder, is the solid cut from a circular cylinder by two (or more) planes.\u000aIf there are two cutting planes, one perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder and the other titled with respect to it, the resulting solid is known as a cylindrical wedge.
p398
aVA cylindric section is the intersection of a plane with a right circular cylinder. It is a circle (if the plane is at a right angle to the axis), an ellipse, or, if the plane is parallel to the axis, a single line (if the plane is tangent to the cylinder), pair of parallel lines bounding an infinite rectangle (if the plane cuts the cylinder), or no intersection at all (if the plane misses the cylinder entirely, pp. 7-8).
p399
aVThe inner and outer spheres tangent internally to a cone and also to a plane intersecting the cone are called Dandelin spheres.\u000aThe spheres can be used to show that the intersection of the plane with the cone is an ellipse. Let \u03c0 be a plane intersecting a right circular cone with vertex O in the curve E. Call the spheres tangent to the cone and the plane S_1 and S_2, and the circles on which the spheres are tangent to the cone R_1 and R_2. Pick a line along the cone which intersects R_1 at Q, E at P, and R_2 at T. Call the points on the plane where the sphere are tangent F_1 and F_2.

aVDawson's integral, also sometimes called Dawson's function, is the entire function given by the integral\u000aF(x) | = | e^(-x^2) integral_0^x e^(y^2) dy\u000a | = | 1/2 sqrt(\u03c0) e^(-x^2) erfi(x), where erfi(x) is erfi, that arises in computation of the Voigt lineshape, in heat conduction, and in the theory of electrical oscillations in certain special vacuum tubes. It is commonly denoted F(x) , although Spanier and Oldham denote it by daw(x).

aVA graph whose nodes are sequences of symbols from some alphabet and whose edges indicate the sequences which might overlap. The above figures show the first few n-dimensional de Bruijn graphs on m symbols (m, n) for m, n>=2. The graph (m, n) is implemented in the Wolfram Language as DeBruijnGraph[m, n].\u000aThe independence number of the de Bruijn graphs (2, n) for n = 1, 2, ... are given by 1, 2, 3, 7, 13, 28, ... (OEIS A006946).

aVDecimal is the base-10 notational system for representing real numbers. The expression of a number using the decimal system is called its decimal expansion, examples of which include 1, 13, 2028, 12.1, and 3.14159.\u000aEach of the arabic numerals 0 to 9 is called a decimal digit, and the period placed to the right of the units place in a decimal number is called the decimal point (or, in the case that a comma is instead used for this purpose, the decimal comma).
p407
aVThe decimal expansion of a number is its representation in base-10 (i.e., in the decimal system). In this system, each "decimal place" consists of a digit 0-9 arranged such that each digit is multiplied by a power of 10, decreasing from left to right, and with a decimal place indicating the 10^0 = 1s place. For example, the number with decimal expansion 1234.56 is defined as\u000a1234.56 | = | 1×10^3 + 2×10^2 + 3×10^1 + 4×10^0 + 5×10^(-1) + 6×10^(-2)\u000a | = | 1×1000 + 2×100 + 3×10 + 4 + 5×1/10 + 6×1/100.

aVThe inversion of a convolution equation, i.e., the solution for f of an equation of the form\u000af*g = h + \u03f5, given g and h, where \u03f5 is the noise and * denotes the convolution. Deconvolution is ill-posed and will usually not have a unique solution even in the absence of noise.\u000aLinear deconvolution algorithms include inverse filtering and Wiener filtering. Nonlinear algorithms include the CLEAN algorithm, maximum entropy method, and LUCY.
p409
aVA set partition of the rational numbers into two nonempty subsets S_1 and S_2 such that all members of S_1 are less than those of S_2 and such that S_1 has no greatest member. Real numbers can be defined using either Dedekind cuts or Cauchy sequences.
p410
aVA definite integral is an integral\u000a integral_a^b f(x) dx\u000awith upper and lower limits. If x is restricted to lie on the real line, the definite integral is known as a Riemann integral (which is the usual definition encountered in elementary textbooks). However, a general definite integral is taken in the complex plane, resulting in the contour integral\u000a integral_a^b f(z) dz, with a, b, and z in general being complex numbers and the path of integration from a to b known as a contour.
p411
aVA limiting case in which a class of object changes its nature so as to belong to another, usually simpler, class. For example, the point is a degenerate case of the circle as the radius approaches 0, and the circle is a degenerate form of an ellipse as the eccentricity approaches 0. Another example is the two identical roots of the second-order polynomial (x - 1)^2. Since the n roots of an nth degree polynomial are usually distinct, roots which coincide are said to be degenerate. Degenerate cases often require special treatment in numerical and analytical solutions. For example, a simple search for both roots of the above equation would find only a single one: 1.
p412
aVThe word "degree" has many meanings in mathematics.\u000aThe most common meaning is the unit of angle measure defined such that an entire rotation is 360°. This unit harks back to the Babylonians, who used a base 60 number system. 360° likely arises from the Babylonian year, which was composed of 360 days (12 months of 30 days each). The degree is subdivided into 60 arc minutes per degree, and 60 arc seconds per arc minute. In the Wolfram Language, the symbol giving the number of radians in one degree is Degree.\u000aThe word "degree" is also used in many contexts where it is synonymous with "order, " as applied for example to polynomials.
p413
aVThe number of degrees of freedom in a problem, distribution, etc., is the number of parameters which may be independently varied.

aVGiven an undirected graph, a degree sequence is a monotonic nonincreasing sequence of the vertex degrees (valencies) of its graph vertices. The number of degree sequences for a graph of a given order is closely related to graphical partitions. The sum of the elements of a degree sequence of a graph is always even due to fact that each edge connects two vertices and is thus counted twice.\u000aThe minimum vertex degree in a graph G is denoted \u03b4(G), and the maximum vertex degree is denoted \u0394(G). A graph whose degree sequence contains only multiple copies of a single integer is called a regular graph. A graph corresponding to a given degree sequence d can be constructed in the Wolfram Language using RandomGraph[DegreeGraphDistribution[d]].

aVAn invariant defined using the angles of a three-dimensional polyhedron. It remains constant under solid dissection and reassembly. Solids with the same volume can have different Dehn invariants.\u000aTwo polyhedra can be dissected into each other only if they have the same volume and the same Dehn invariant. In 1902, Dehn showed that two interdissectable polyhedra must have equal Dehn invariants, settling the third of Hilbert's problems, and Sydler showed that two polyhedra with the same Dehn invariants are interdissectable.

aVThe Delannoy numbers D(a, b) are the number of lattice paths from (0, 0) to (b, a) in which only east (1, 0), north (0, 1), and northeast (1, 1) steps are allowed (i.e., ->, \u2191, and \u2197). They are given by the recurrence relation\u000aD(a, b) = D(a - 1, b) + D(a, b - 1) + D(a - 1, b - 1), with D(0, 0) = 1.

aVThe Delaunay triangulation is a triangulation which is equivalent to the nerve of the cells in a Voronoi diagram, i.e., that triangulation of the convex hull of the points in the diagram in which every circumcircle of a triangle is an empty circle .\u000aThe Wolfram Language command PlanarGraphPlot[pts] in the Wolfram Language package ComputationalGeometry \u0300 plots the Delaunay triangulation of the given list of points. Qhull may be used to compute these structures efficiently.\u000aThe Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi diagram in R^2 are dual to each other.

aVThe delta function is a generalized function that can be defined as the limit of a class of delta sequences. The delta function is sometimes called "Dirac's delta function" or the "impulse symbol". It is implemented in the Wolfram Language as DiracDelta[x].\u000aFormally, \u03b4 is a linear functional from a space (commonly taken as a Schwartz space S or the space of all smooth functions of compact support D) of test functions f. The action of \u03b4 on f, commonly denoted \u03b4[f] or \u2329\u03b4, f\u232a, then gives the value at 0 of f for any function f. In engineering contexts, the functional nature of the delta function is often suppressed.

aVA 3-cusped hypocycloid, also called a tricuspoid. The deltoid was first considered by Euler in 1745 in connection with an optical problem. It was also investigated by Steiner in 1856 and is sometimes called Steiner's hypocycloid (Lockwood 1967, p. 44; MacTutor). The equation of the deltoid is obtained by setting n congruent a/b = 3 in the equation of the hypocycloid, where a is the radius of the large fixed circle and b is the radius of the small rolling circle, yielding the parametric equations

aVThe deltoidal hexecontahedron is the 60-faced dual polyhedron of the small rhombicosidodecahedron A_5. It is sometimes also called the trapezoidal hexecontahedron, strombic hexecontahedron, or dyakis hexecontahedron. It is Wenninger dual W_14.\u000aA tetrahedron 10-compound, octahedron 5-compound, cube 5-compound, icosahedron, dodecahedron, and icosidodecahedron can all be inscribed in the vertices of the deltoidal hexecontahedron (E.

p424
aVIn continuum theory, a dendrite is a locally connected continuum that contains no simple closed curve. A semicircle is therefore a dendrite, while a triangle is not.\u000aThe term dendrite is used by Steinhaus to refer to a system of line segments connecting a given set of points, where the total length of paths is as short as possible (therefore implying that no closed cycles are permitted) and the paths are not allowed to cross. This definition differs from the one in continuum theory since a semicircle is a dendritic continuum but is not a line segment.

aVA derangement is a permutation in which none of the objects appear in their "natural" (i.e., ordered) place. For example, the only derangements of {1, 2, 3} are {2, 3, 1} and {3, 1, 2}, so !3 = 2. Similarly, the derangements of {1, 2, 3, 4} are {2, 1, 4, 3}, {2, 3, 4, 1}, {2, 4, 1, 3}, {3, 1, 4, 2}, {3, 4, 1, 2}, {3, 4, 2, 1}, {4, 1, 2, 3}, {4, 3, 1, 2}, and {4, 3, 2, 1}. Derangements are permutations without fixed points (i.e., having no cycles of length one). The derangements of a list of n elements can be computed in the Wolfram Language using

aVThe derivative of a function represents an infinitesimal change in the function with respect to one of its variables.\u000aThe "simple" derivative of a function f with respect to a variable x is denoted either f'(x) or\u000a(df)/(dx), often written in-line as df/dx. When derivatives are taken with respect to time, they are often denoted using Newton's overdot notation for fluxions, (dx)/(dt) = x^. .

aVGiven a polygon with an even number of sides, the derived polygon is obtained by joining the points which are a fractional distance r along each side. If r = 1/2, then the derived polygons are called midpoint polygons and tend to a shape with opposite sides parallel and equal in length. Furthermore, alternate polygons have approximately the same length, and the original and all derived polygons have the same centroid.

aVA special case of Apollonius' problem requiring the determination of a circle touching three mutually tangent circles (also called the kissing circles problem). There are two solutions: a small circle surrounded by the three original circles, and a large circle surrounding the original three. Frederick Soddy gave the formula for finding the radius of the so-called inner and outer Soddy circles given the radii of the other three. The relationship is\u000a2(\u03ba_1^2 + \u03ba_2^2 + \u03ba_3^2 + \u03ba_4^2) = (\u03ba_1 + \u03ba_2 + \u03ba_3 + \u03ba_4)^2, where \u03ba_i = 1/r_i are the curvatures of the circles with radii r_i. Here, the negative solution corresponds to the outer Soddy circle and the positive solution to the inner Soddy circle.

aVA method of determining the maximum number of positive and negative real roots of a polynomial.\u000aFor positive roots, start with the sign of the coefficient of the lowest (or highest) power. Count the number of sign changes n as you proceed from the lowest to the highest power (ignoring powers which do not appear). Then n is the maximum number of positive roots. Furthermore, the number of allowable roots is n, n - 2, n - 4, .... For example, consider the polynomial\u000af(x) = x^7 + x^6 - x^4 - x^3 - x^2 + x - 1.

aVDeterminants are mathematical objects that are very useful in the analysis and solution of systems of linear equations. As shown by Cramer's rule, a nonhomogeneous system of linear equations has a unique solution iff the determinant of the system's matrix is nonzero (i.e., the matrix is nonsingular). For example, eliminating x, y, and z from the equations\u000aa_1 x + a_2 y + a_3 z | = | 0\u000ab_1 x + b_2 y + b_3 z | = | 0\u000ac_1 x + c_2 y + c_3 z | = | 0\u000agives the expression\u000aa_1 b_2 c_3 - a_1 b_3 c_2 + a_2 b_3 c_1 - a_2 b_1 c_3 + a_3 b_1 c_2 - a_3 b_2 c_1 = 0,

aVA developable surface is a ruled surface having Gaussian curvature K = 0 everywhere. Developable surfaces therefore include the cone, cylinder, elliptic cone, hyperbolic cylinder, and plane.\u000aA developable surface has the property that it can be made out of sheet metal, since such a surface must be obtainable by transformation from a plane (which has Gaussian curvature 0) and every point on such a surface lies on at least one straight line.
p435
aVThe diameter of a circle is the distance from a point on the circle to a point \u03c0 radians away, and is the maximum distance from one point on a circle to another. The diameter of a sphere is the maximum distance between two antipodal points on the surface of the sphere.\u000aIf r is the radius of a circle or sphere, then d = 2r. The ratio of the circumference C of a circle or great circle of a sphere to the diameter d is pi, \u03c0 = C/d.

aVA die (plural "dice") is a solid with markings on each of its faces. The faces are usually all the same shape, making Platonic solids and Archimedean duals the obvious choices. The die can be "rolled" by throwing it in the air and allowing it to come to rest on one of its faces. Dice are used in many games of chance as a way of picking random numbers on which to bet, and are used in board or role-playing games to determine the number of spaces to move, results of a conflict, etc. A coin can be viewed as a degenerate 2-sided case of a die.\u000aIn 1787, Mozart wrote the measures and instructions for a musical composition dice game. The idea is to cut and paste pre-written measures of music together to create a Minuet (Chuang).

aV\u0394_h f(x) congruent (f(x + h) - f(x))/h = (\u0394f)/h.\u000aIt gives the slope of the secant line passing through f(x) and f(x + h). In the limit h->0, the difference quotient becomes the partial derivative\u000alim_(h->0) \u0394_(x(h)) f(x, y) = (df)/(dx).

aVLet G be a group of group order h and D be a set of k elements of G. If the set of differences d_i - d_j contains every nonzero element of G exactly \u03bb times, then D is a (h, k, \u03bb)-difference set in G of order n = k - \u03bb. If \u03bb = 1, the difference set is called planar. The quadratic residues in the finite field GF(11) form a difference set. If there is a difference set of size k in a group G, then 2(k\u000a2) must be a multiple of left bracketing bar G right bracketing bar - 1, where (k\u000a2) is a binomial coefficient.\u000aGordon maintains an index of known difference sets.

aVA real function is said to be differentiable at a point if its derivative exists at that point. The notion of differentiability can also be extended to complex functions (leading to the Cauchy-Riemann equations and the theory of holomorphic functions), although a few additional subtleties arise in complex differentiability that are not present in the real case.\u000aAmazingly, there exist continuous functions which are nowhere differentiable. Two examples are the Blancmange function and Weierstrass function. Hermite is said to have opined, "I turn away with fright and horror from this lamentable evil of functions which do not have derivatives".

aVDifferential calculus is that portion of "the" calculus dealing with derivatives.\u000aAmong his many other talents, Major General Stanley in Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta the Pirates of Penzance impresses the pirates with his knowledge of calculus in "The Major General's Song" as follows: "I'm very good at integral and differential calculus, I know the scientific names of beings animalculous; In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral, I am the very model of a modern Major-General."
p441
aVA differential equation is an equation that involves the derivatives of a function as well as the function itself. If partial derivatives are involved, the equation is called a partial differential equation; if only ordinary derivatives are present, the equation is called an ordinary differential equation. Differential equations play an extremely important and useful role in applied math, engineering, and physics, and much mathematical and numerical machinery has been developed for the solution of differential equations.

aVStart with an integer n, known as the digitaddition generator. Add the sum of the digitaddition generator's digits to obtain the digitaddition n'. A number can have more than one digitaddition generator. If a number has no digitaddition generator, it is called a self number. The sum of all numbers in a digitaddition series is given by the last term minus the first plus the sum of the digits of the last.

aVThe dihedral group D_n is the symmetry group of an n-sided regular polygon for n>1. The group order of D_n is 2n. Dihedral groups D_n are non-Abelian permutation groups for n>2.\u000aThe nth dihedral group is represented in the Wolfram Language as DihedralGroup[n].\u000aOne group presentation for the dihedral group D_n is \u2329x, y|x^2 = 1, y^n = 1, (xy)^2 = 1\u232a.

aVThe dihedral group D_4 is one of the two non-Abelian groups of the five groups total of group order 8. It is sometimes called the octic group. An example of D_4 is the symmetry group of the square.\u000aThe cycle graph of D_4 is shown above. D_4 has cycle index given by\u000aZ(D_4) = 1/8 x_1^4 + 1/4 x_2 x_1^2 + 3/8 x_2^2 + 1/4 x_4 .\u000aIts multiplication table is illustrated above.

aVDijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding a graph geodesic, i.e., the shortest path between two graph vertices in a graph. It functions by constructing a shortest-path tree from the initial vertex to every other vertex in the graph.

aVThe dimension of an object is a topological measure of the size of its covering properties. Roughly speaking, it is the number of coordinates needed to specify a point on the object. For example, a rectangle is two-dimensional, while a cube is three-dimensional. The dimension of an object is sometimes also called its "dimensionality."\u000aThe prefix "hyper-" is usually used to refer to the four- (and higher-) dimensional analogs of three-dimensional objects, e.g., hypercube, hyperplane.

aVA dipyramid, also called a bipyramid, consistes of two pyramids symmetrically placed base-to-base. The dipyramids are duals of the regular prisms. Their skeletons are the dipyramidal graphs.\u000aThe volume of a dipyramid of half-height h and base area A_b is equal to twice the volume of the corresponding pyramid, namely\u000aV = 2/3 A_b h.\u000aThe volume of a dipyramid whose base is a regular n-sided polygon with side a is therefore\u000aV_n = 1/6 ncot(\u03c0/n) a^2 h.

aVThe Dirac matrices are a class of 4×4 matrices which arise in quantum electrodynamics. There are a variety of different symbols used, and Dirac matrices are also known as gamma matrices or Dirac gamma matrices.\u000aThe Dirac matrices \u03b1_n may be implemented in a future version of the Wolfram Language as DiracGammaMatrix[n], where n = 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
p453
aVA graph in which each graph edge is replaced by a directed graph edge, also called a digraph. A directed graph having no multiple edges or loops (corresponding to a binary adjacency matrix with 0s on the diagonal) is called a simple directed graph. A complete graph in which each edge is bidirected is called a complete directed graph. A directed graph having no symmetric pair of directed edges (i.e., no bidirected edges) is called an oriented graph. A complete oriented graph (i.e., a directed graph in which each pair of nodes is joined by a single edge having a unique direction) is called a tournament.

aVThe directional derivative del _u f(x_0, y_0, z_0) is the rate at which the function f(x, y, z) changes at a point (x_0, y_0, z_0) in the direction u. It is a vector form of the usual derivative, and can be defined as\u000a del _u f | congruent | del f·u/( left bracketing bar u right bracketing bar )\u000a | = | lim_(h->0) (f(x + hu^^) - f(x))/h, where del is called "nabla" or "del" and u^^ denotes a unit vector.

aVLet the divisor function d(n) be the number of divisors of n (including n itself). For a prime p, d(p) = 2. In general, sum_(k = 1)^n d(k) = nlnn + (2\u03b3 - 1) n + O(n^\u03b8), where \u03b3 is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. Dirichlet originally gave \u03b8\u22481/2 (Hardy and Wright 1979, p. 264; Hardy 1999, pp. 67-68), and Hardy and Landau showed in 1916 that \u03b8>=1/4. The following table summarizes incremental progress on the upper limit (updating Hardy 1999, p. 81).

aVLet c and d!=c be real numbers (usually taken as c = 1 and d = 0). The Dirichlet function is defined by\u000aD(x) = {c | for x rational\u000ad | for x irrational auto right match \u000aand is discontinuous everywhere. The Dirichlet function can be written analytically as\u000aD(x) = lim_(m->\u221e) lim_(n->\u221e) cos^(2n)(m!\u03c0x).

aVA Dirichlet L-series is a series of the form\u000aL_k(s, \u03c7) congruent sum_(n = 1)^\u221e \u03c7_k(n) n^(-s), where the number theoretic character \u03c7_k(n) is an integer function with period k, are called Dirichlet L-series. These series are very important in additive number theory (they were used, for instance, to prove Dirichlet's theorem), and have a close connection with modular forms. Dirichlet L-series can be written as sums of Lerch transcendents with z a power of e^(2\u03c0i/k).\u000aDirichlet L-series is implemented in the Wolfram Language as DirichletL[k, j, s] for the Dirichlet character \u03c7(n) with modulus k and index j.

aVGiven an arithmetic progression of terms an + b, for n = 1, 2, ..., the series contains an infinite number of primes if a and b are relatively prime, i.e., (a, b) = 1. This result had been conjectured by Gauss, but was first proved by Dirichlet.\u000aDirichlet proved this theorem using Dirichlet L-series, but the proof is challenging enough that, in their classic text on number theory, the usually explicit Hardy and Wright report "this theorem is too difficult for insertion in this book."

aVA discontinuity is point at which a mathematical object is discontinuous. The left figure above illustrates a discontinuity in a one-variable function while the right figure illustrates a discontinuity of a two-variable function plotted as a surface in R^3. In the latter case, the discontinuity is a branch cut along the negative real axis of the natural logarithm lnz for complex z.\u000aSome authors refer to a discontinuity of a function as a jump, though this is rarely utilized in the literature.

aVAny two rectilinear figures with equal area can be dissected into a finite number of pieces to form each other. This is the Wallace-Bolyai-Gerwien theorem. For minimal dissections of a triangle, pentagon, and octagon into a square, see Stewart and Ball and Coxeter. The triangle to square dissection (haberdasher's problem) is particularly interesting because it can be built from hinged pieces which can be folded and unfolded to yield the two shapes. \u000aLaczkovich proved that the circle can be squared in a finite number of dissections (~10^50). Furthermore, any shape whose boundary is composed of smoothly curving pieces can be dissected into a square.
p469
aVA dissection fallacy is an apparent paradox arising when two plane figures with different areas seem to be composed by the same finite set of parts. In order to produce this illusion, the pieces have to be cut and reassembled so skillfully, that the missing or exceeding area is hidden by tiny, negligible imperfections of shape.\u000aA strikingly simple and enlightening example can be constructed by dissecting an 8×8 checkerboard in four pieces as depicted. The middle and right figures then seem to demonstrate that the same pieces can give rise to two different polygons having area 5×13 = 65 and 2(5×6) + 3 = 63, respectively. This would imply that 63 = 64 = 65.

aVA multiplication * is said to be right distributive if\u000a(x + y) z = xz + yz\u000afor every x, y, and z. Similarly, it is said to be left distributive if\u000az(x + y) = zx + zy\u000afor every x, y, and z.\u000aIf a multiplication is both right- and left-distributive, it is simply said to be distributive. For example, the real numbers R are distributive.

aVThe divergence of a vector field F, denoted div(F) or del ·F (the notation used in this work), is defined by a limit of the surface integral\u000a del ·F congruent lim_(V->0) (\u222e_S F·da)/V\u000awhere the surface integral gives the value of F integrated over a closed infinitesimal boundary surface S = dV surrounding a volume element V, which is taken to size zero using a limiting process. The divergence of a vector field is therefore a scalar field. If del ·F = 0, then the field is said to be a divergenceless field. The symbol del is variously known as "nabla" or "del."

aVA series which is not convergent. Series may diverge by marching off to infinity or by oscillating. Divergent series have some curious properties. For example, rearranging the terms of 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - ... gives both (1 - 1) + (1 - 1) + (1 - 1) + ... = 0 and 1 - (1 - 1) - (1 - 1) + ... = 1.\u000aThe Riemann series theorem states that, by a suitable rearrangement of terms, a conditionally convergent series may be made to converge to any desired value, or to diverge.

aVWrite a positive decimal integer a out digit by digit in the form a_n ...a_3 a_2 a_1 a_0. The following rules then determine if a is divisible by another number by examining the congruence properties of its digits. In congruence notation, n congruent k (mod m) means that the remainder when n is divided by a modulus m is k. (Note that it is always true that 10^0 = 1 congruent 1 for any base.) \u000a 1. All integers are divisible by 1. \u000a 2. 10^1 congruent 0 (mod 2), so 10^n congruent 0 (mod 2) for n>=1. Therefore, if the last digit a_0 is divisible by 2 (i.e., is even), then so is a.
p479
aVA number n is said to be divisible by d if d is a divisor of n.\u000aThe function Divisible[n, d] returns True if an integer n is divisible by an integer d.\u000aThe product of any n consecutive integers is divisible by n!. The sum of any n consecutive integers is divisible by n if n is odd, and by n/2 if n is even.

aVTaking the ratio x/y of two numbers x and y, also written x÷y. Here, x is called the dividend, y is called the divisor, and x/y is called a quotient. The symbol "/" is called a solidus (sometimes, the "diagonal"), and the symbol "÷" is called the obelus. If left unevaluated, x/y is called a fraction, with x known as the numerator and y known as the denominator.\u000aDivision in which the fractional (remainder) is discarded is called integer division, and is sometimes denoted using a backslash, \u005c.
p481
aVA division algebra, also called a "division ring" or "skew field, " is a ring in which every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse, but multiplication is not necessarily commutative. Every field is therefore also a division algebra. In French, the term "corps non commutatif" is used to mean division algebra, while "corps" alone means field.
p482
aVDivision by zero is the operation of taking the quotient of any number x and 0, i.e., x/0. The uniqueness of division breaks down when dividing by zero, since the product 0·y = 0 is the same for any y, so y cannot be recovered by inverting the process of multiplication. 0 is the only number with this property and, as a result, division by zero is undefined for real numbers and can produce a fatal condition called a "division by zero error" in computer programs.

aVA (general dodecahedron) is a polyhedron having 12 faces. Examples include the decagonal prism, elongated square dipyramid (Johnson solid J_15), hexagonal dipyramid, metabidiminished icosahedron (J_62), pentagonal antiprism, pentagonal cupola (J_5), (regular) dodecahedron, rhombic dodecahedron, snub disphenoid (J_84), triakis tetrahedron, and undecagonal pyramid. Crystals of pyrite (FeS_2) resemble slightly distorted dodecahedra, and sphalerite (ZnS) crystals are irregular dodecahedra bounded by congruent deltoids. The hexagonal scalenohedron is another irregular dodecahedron.
p486
aVThe term domain has (at least) three different meanings in mathematics.\u000aThe term domain is most commonly used to describe the set of values D for which a function (map, transformation, etc.) is defined. For example, a function f(x) that is defined for real values x element R has domain R, and is sometimes said to be "a function over the reals." The set of values to which D is sent by the function is then called the range.

aVThe dot product can be defined for two vectors X and Y by\u000aX·Y = left bracketing bar X right bracketing bar left bracketing bar Y right bracketing bar cos\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle between the vectors and left bracketing bar X right bracketing bar is the norm. It follows immediately that X·Y = 0 if X is perpendicular to Y. The dot product therefore has the geometric interpretation as the length of the projection of X onto the unit vector Y^^ when the two vectors are placed so that their tails coincide.

aVA double bubble is pair of bubbles which intersect and are separated by a membrane bounded by the intersection. The usual double bubble is illustrated in the left figure above. A more exotic configuration in which one bubble is torus-shaped and the other is shaped like a dumbbell is illustrated at right (illustrations courtesy of J. M. Sullivan).\u000aIn the plane, the analog of the double bubble consists of three circular arcs meeting in two points. It has been proved that the configuration of arcs meeting at equal 120° angles) has the minimum perimeter for enclosing two equal areas (Alfaro et al. 1993, Morgan 1995).

aVA dragon curve is a recursive nonintersecting curve whose name derives from its resemblance to a certain mythical creature.\u000aThe curve can be constructed by representing a left turn by 1 and a right turn by 0. The first-order curve is then denoted 1. For higher order curves, append a 1 to the end, then append the string of preceding digits with its middle digit complemented. For example, the second-order curve is generated as follows: (1)1->(1)1(0)->110, and the third as (110)1->(110)1(100)->1101100.

aVA dual number is a number x + \u03f5y, where x, y element R and \u03f5 is a matrix with the property that \u03f5^2 = 0 (such as \u03f5 = [0 | 1\u000a0 | 0]).
p494
aVBy the duality principle, for every polyhedron, there exists another polyhedron in which faces and polyhedron vertices occupy complementary locations. This polyhedron is known as the dual, or reciprocal. The process of taking the dual is also called reciprocation, or polar reciprocation. Brückner was among the first to give a precise definition of duality.\u000aThe dual of a Platonic solid or Archimedean solid can be computed by connecting the midpoints of the sides surrounding each polyhedron vertex (the vertex figure; left figure), and constructing the corresponding tangential polygon (tangent to the circumcircle of the vertex figure; right figure). This is sometimes called the Dorman-Luke construction.

aVA two-person game where each of the players can take as long as he likes to prepare his move, but the other can take advantage of his hesitation. In this conflict situation, the winning strategy is entirely based on choosing the right moment for action.\u000aThe typical example is that of two fighters approaching each other with a pistol. As time passes, the decreasing distance increases the probability of hitting the target.

aVA means of describing how one state develops into another state over the course of time. Technically, a dynamical system is a smooth action of the reals or the integers on another object (usually a manifold). When the reals are acting, the system is called a continuous dynamical system, and when the integers are acting, the system is called a discrete dynamical system. If f is any continuous function, then the evolution of a variable x can be given by the formula\u000ax_(n + 1) = f(x_n).

aVThe Earth-Moon problem is a special case of the empire problem for countries with m = 2 disjoint regions, with one region of each country lying on the Earth and one on the Moon. The additional constraint means that fewer than 12 colors might suffice. And in fact, Ringel gave an example requiring only 8 colors. Gardner reported an example requiring 9 colors, but it is not known if configurations exist requiring 10, 11, or 12 colors.

aVAn edge coloring of a graph G is a coloring of the edges of G such that adjacent edges (or the edges bounding different regions) receive different colors. An edge coloring containing the smallest possible number of colors for a given graph is known as a minimum edge coloring.\u000aA (not necessarily minimum) edge coloring of a graph can be computed using EdgeColoring[g] in the Wolfram Language package Combinatorica \u0300 .\u000aThe edge chromatic number gives the minimum number of colors with which graph's edges can be colored.
p503
aVIn a graph G, contraction of an edge e with endpoints u, v is the replacement of u and v with a single vertex such that edges incident to the new vertex are the edges other than e that were incident with u or v. The resulting graph G·e has one less edge than G.\u000aGraph minors are defined in terms of edge contractions.

aVAn Egyptian fraction is a sum of positive (usually) distinct unit fractions. The famous Rhind papyrus, dated to around 1650 BC contains a table of representations of 2/n as Egyptian fractions for odd n between 5 and 101. The reason the Egyptians chose this method for representing fractions is not clear, although André Weil characterized the decision as "a wrong turn". The unique fraction that the Egyptians did not represent using unit fractions was 2/3.
p505
aVThe matrix decomposition of a square matrix A into so-called eigenvalues and eigenvectors is an extremely important one. This decomposition generally goes under the name "matrix diagonalization." However, this moniker is less than optimal, since the process being described is really the decomposition of a matrix into a product of three other matrices, only one of which is diagonal, and also because all other standard types of matrix decomposition use the term "decomposition" in their names, e.g., Cholesky decomposition, Hessenberg decomposition, and so on. As a result, the decomposition of a matrix into matrices composed of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues is called eigen decomposition in this work.

aVEigenvalues are a special set of scalars associated with a linear system of equations (i.e., a matrix equation) that are sometimes also known as characteristic roots, characteristic values, proper values, or latent roots.\u000aThe determination of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a system is extremely important in physics and engineering, where it is equivalent to matrix diagonalization and arises in such common applications as stability analysis, the physics of rotating bodies, and small oscillations of vibrating systems, to name only a few. Each eigenvalue is paired with a corresponding so-called eigenvector (or, in general, a corresponding right eigenvector and a corresponding left eigenvector; there is no analogous distinction between left and right for eigenvalues).

aVInformally, an elliptic curve is a type of cubic curve whose solutions are confined to a region of space that is topologically equivalent to a torus. The Weierstrass elliptic function \u2118(z;g_2, g_3) describes how to get from this torus to the algebraic form of an elliptic curve.\u000aFormally, an elliptic curve over a field K is a nonsingular cubic curve in two variables, f(X, Y) = 0, with a K-rational point (which may be a point at infinity). The field K is usually taken to be the complex numbers C, reals R, rationals Q, algebraic extensions of Q, p-adic numbers Q_p, or a finite field.

aVElliptic geometry is a non-Euclidean geometry with positive curvature which replaces the parallel postulate with the statement "through any point in the plane, there exist no lines parallel to a given line." In order to achieve a consistent system, however, the basic axioms of neutral geometry must be partially modified. Most notably, the axioms of betweenness are no longer sufficient (essentially because betweenness on a great circle makes no sense, namely if A and B are on a circle and C is between them, then the relative position of C is not uniquely specified), and so must be replaced with the axioms of subsets.

aVIn physics, the word entropy has important physical implications as the amount of "disorder" of a system. In mathematics, a more abstract definition is used. The (Shannon) entropy of a variable X is defined as\u000aH(X) congruent - sum_x P(x) log_2[P(x)]\u000abits, where P(x) is the probability that X is in the state x, and Plog_2 P is defined as 0 if P = 0. The joint entropy of variables X_1, ..., X_n is then defined by\u000aH(X_1, ..., X_n) congruent - sum_(x_1) ... sum_(x_n) P(x_1, ..., x_n) log_2[P(x_1, ..., x_n)].

aVRelates evolutes to single paths in the calculus of variations. Proved in the general case by Darboux and Zermelo in 1894 and Kneser in 1898. It states: "When a single parameter family of external paths from a fixed point O has an envelope, the integral from the fixed point to any point A on the envelope equals the integral from the fixed point to any second point B on the envelope plus the integral along the envelope to the first point on the envelope, J_(OA) = J_(OB) + J_(BA)."

aVThe roulette traced by a point P attached to a circle of radius b rolling around the outside of a fixed circle of radius a. These curves were studied by Dürer, Desargues, Huygens, Leibniz, Newton in 1686, L'Hospital in 1690, Jakob Bernoulli in 1690, la Hire in 1694, Johann Bernoulli in 1695, Daniel Bernoulli in 1725, and Euler in 1745 and 1781. An epitrochoid appears in Dürer's work Instruction in Measurement with Compasses and Straight Edge in 1525. He called epitrochoids spider lines because the lines he used to construct the curves looked like a spider.

aVAn epsilon-delta definition is a mathematical definition in which a statement on a real function of one variable f having, for example, the form "for all neighborhoods U of y_0 there is a neighborhood V of x_0 such that, whenever x element V, then f(x) element U" is rephrased as "for all \u03f5>0 there is \u03b4>0 such that, whenever 0< left bracketing bar x - x_0 right bracketing bar <\u03b4, then left bracketing bar f(x) - y_0 right bracketing bar <\u03f5." These two statements are equivalent formulations of the definition of the limit (lim_(x->x_0) f(x) = y_0). In the second one, the neighborhood U is replaced by the open interval (y_0 - \u03f5, y_0 + \u03f5), and the neighborhood V by the open interval (x_0 - \u03b4, x_0 + \u03b4). For a function of n variables, the absolute value would be replaced by the norm left double bracketing bar · right double bracketing bar of R^n, and the open intervals by the open balls B(y_0, \u03f5) and B(x_0, \u03b4) respectively.\u000aThis does not affect the meaning of the statement, since every neighborhood of a given point contains an open ball centered at that point. Hence requiring that, for any \u03f5>0, f(x) element B(y_0, \u03f5) for suitable values of x, ensures that for suitable values of x, f(x) element U for any neighborhood U of y_0. These suitable values of x are, according to both versions of the definition, those belonging to a suitable neighborhood (an open ball in the second one).\u000aBoth statements express the fact that for all x which lie close enough to x_0, f(x) lies as close to y_0 as desired. In the second formulation this condition is entirely expressed in terms of numbers: \u03f5 and \u03b4 are distances that measures the "closeness." This facilitates the task of proving limits since the fundamental formulas are actually shown by constructing, for every \u03f5, a \u03b4 with the required property.

aVAn equilateral zonohedron is a zonohedron in which the line segments of the star on which it is based are of equal length. Plate II (following p. 32 of Coxeter 1973) illustrates some equilateral zonohedra. Equilateral zonohedra can be regarded as three-dimensional projections of n-dimensional hypercubes.\u000a2n-prisms are zonohedra and may be equilateral. The following table summarizes some equilateral zonohedra together with their basis vectors. As can be seen, a single Platonic solid (the cube), three Archimedean solids (the great rhombicosidodecahedron, great rhombicuboctahedron, and truncated octahedron), and two Archimedean dual (the rhombic dodecahedron and rhombic triacontahedron) are equilateral zonohedra (Ball and Coxeter 1987, Towle 1996).

aVAn equivalence relation on a set X is a subset of X×X, i.e., a collection R of ordered pairs of elements of X, satisfying certain properties. Write "xRy" to mean (x, y) is an element of R, and we say "x is related to y, " then the properties are \u000a1. Reflexive: aRa for all a element X, 2. Symmetric: aRb implies bRa for all a, b element X \u000a3. Transitive: aRb and bRc imply aRc for all a, b, c element X, where these three properties are completely independent. Other notations are often used to indicate a relation, e.g., a congruent b or a~b.

aVAccording to Euler's rotation theorem, any rotation may be described using three angles. If the rotations are written in terms of rotation matrices D, C, and B, then a general rotation A can be written as\u000aA = BCD.\u000aThe three angles giving the three rotation matrices are called Euler angles. There are several conventions for Euler angles, depending on the axes about which the rotations are carried out. Write the matrix A as\u000aA congruent [a_11 | a_12 | a_13\u000aa_21 | a_22 | a_23\u000aa_31 | a_32 | a_33].

aVAn implicit method for solving an ordinary differential equation that uses f(x_n, y_n) in y_(n + 1). In the case of a heat equation, for example, this means that a linear system must be solved at each time step. However, unlike the Euler forward method, the backward method is unconditionally stable and so allows large time steps to be taken.

aVA method for solving ordinary differential equations using the formula\u000ay_(n + 1) = y_n + hf(x_n, y_n), which advances a solution from x_n to x_(n + 1) = x_n + h. Note that the method increments a solution through an interval h while using derivative information from only the beginning of the interval. As a result, the step's error is O(h^2). This method is called simply "the Euler method" by Press et al. (1992), although it is actually the forward version of the analogous Euler backward method.

aVThe Eulerian number \u2329n\u000ak\u232a gives the number of permutations of {1, 2, ..., n} having k permutation ascents . Eulerian numbers \u2329n\u000ak\u232a are implemented as Eulerian[n, k] in the Wolfram Language package Combinatorica \u0300 . Note that a slightly different definition of Eulerian number is used by Comtet, who defines the Eulerian number A(n, k) (sometimes also denoted A_(n, k)) as the number of permutation runs of length k - 1, and hence A(n, k) = \u2329n\u000ak - 1\u232a.

aVThe Euler-Mascheroni constant \u03b3, sometimes also called 'Euler's constant' or 'the Euler constant' (but not to be confused with the constant e = 2.71828...) is defined as the limit of the sequence\u000a\u03b3 | = | lim_(n->\u221e)( sum_(k = 1)^n 1/k - lnn)\u000a | = | lim_(n->\u221e)(H_n - lnn), where H_n is a harmonic number . It was first defined by Euler, who used the letter C and stated that it was "worthy of serious consideration" (Havil 2003, pp. xx and 51). The symbol \u03b3 was first used by Mascheroni.

Euler numbers give the number of odd alternating permutations and are related to Genocchi numbers. The base e of the natural logarithm is sometimes known as Euler's number.

aVLet O and I be the circumcenter and incenter of a triangle with circumradius R and inradius r. Let d be the distance between O and I. Then\u000ad^2 = R(R - 2r)\u000a(Mackay 1886-1887; Casey 1888, pp. 74-75; Johnson 1929, pp. 186-187; Altshiller-Court 1952, p. 85). This is the simplest case of Poncelet's porism, and is sometimes also known as Euler's triangle theorem.\u000aFrom this theorem, the inequality\u000aR>=2r, sometimes known as Euler's inequality, follows immediately.

aVThe number of alternating permutations for n elements is sometimes called an Euler zigzag number. Denote the number of alternating permutations on n elements for which the first element is k by E(n, k). Then E(1, 1) = 1 and\u000aE(n, k) = {0 | for k>=n or k<1\u000aE(n, k - 1) + E(n - 1, n - k) | otherwise. auto right match \u000awhere E(n, k) is an Entringer number.

aVA univariate function f(x) is said to be even provided that f(x) = f(-x). Geometrically, such functions are symmetric about the y-axis. Examples of even functions include 1 (or, in general, any constant function), left bracketing bar x right bracketing bar , cosx, x^2, and e^(-x^2).\u000aAn even function times an odd function is odd, while the sum or difference of two nonzero functions is even if and only if each summand function is even. The product or quotient of two even functions is again even.
p560
aVAn even number is an integer of the form n = 2k, where k is an integer. The even numbers are therefore ..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ... (OEIS A005843). Since the even numbers are integrally divisible by two, the congruence n congruent 0 (mod 2) holds for even n. An even number n for which n congruent 2 (mod 4) also holds is called a singly even number, while an even number n for which n congruent 0 (mod 4) is called a doubly even number. An integer which is not even is called an odd number.\u000aThe oddness of a number is called its parity, so an odd number has parity 1, while an even number has parity 0.
p561
aVAn even permutation is a permutation obtainable from an even number of two-element swaps, i.e., a permutation with permutation symbol equal to +1. For initial set {1, 2, 3, 4}, the twelve even permutations are those with zero swaps: ({1, 2, 3, 4}); and those with two swaps: ({1, 3, 4, 2}, {1, 4, 2, 3}, {2, 1, 4, 3}, {2, 3, 1, 4}, {2, 4, 3, 1}, {3, 1, 2, 4}, {3, 2, 4, 1}, {3, 4, 1, 2}, {4, 1, 3, 2}, {4, 2, 1, 3}, {4, 3, 2, 1}).\u000aFor a set of n elements and n>2, there are n!/2 even permutations, which is the same as the number of odd permutations. For n = 1, 2, ..., the numbers are given by 0, 1, 3, 12, 60, 360, 2520, 20160, 181440, ... (OEIS A001710).

aVAn evolute is the locus of centers of curvature (the envelope) of a plane curve's normals. The original curve is then said to be the involute of its evolute.

aVThe center J_i of an excircle. There are three excenters for a given triangle, denoted J_1, J_2, J_3. The incenter I and excenters J_i of a triangle are an orthocentric system.\u000a(OI)^_ ^2 + (OJ_1)^_ ^2 + (OJ_2)^_ ^2 + (OJ_3)^_ ^2 = 12R^2, where O is the circumcenter, J_i are the excenters, and R is the circumradius.

aVA Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field is called exceptional if it is constructed from one of the root systems E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, and G_2 by the Chevalley construction. If the field has field characteristic other than 2 or 3, than such Lie algebras are all simple.\u000aThe exceptional Lie algebras over an arbitrary field are those corresponding to the same list of root systems as well as some corresponding to the root system of type D_4 and the phenomenon of triality. Algebras of this last type occur over some fields (finite fields, number fields) and not others (the real numbers, algebraically closed fields).
p569
aVGiven a triangle, extend two sides in the direction opposite their common vertex. The circle tangent to these two lines and to the other side of the triangle is called an excircle, or sometimes an escribed circle. The center J_i of the excircle is called the excenter and lies on the external angle bisector of the opposite angle. Every triangle has three excircles, and the trilinear coordinates of the excenters are -1:1:1, 1:-1:1, and 1:1:-1. The radius r_i of the excircle i is called its exradius.\u000aNote that the three excircles are not necessarily tangent to the incircle, and so these four circles are not equivalent to the configuration of the Soddy circles.\u000aNo Kimberling centers lie on any of the excircles.

Exponential growth is common in physical processes such as population growth in the absence of predators or resource restrictions (where a slightly more general form is known as the law of growth). Exponential growth also occurs as the limit of discrete processes such as compound interest.

aVAn exterior angle \u03b2 of a polygon is the angle formed externally between two adjacent sides. It is therefore equal to 2\u03c0 - \u03b1, where \u03b1 is the corresponding internal angle between two adjacent sides.\u000aConsider the angles \u03b3_i formed between a side of a polygon and the extension of an adjacent side. Since there are two directions in which a side can be extended, there are two such angles at each vertex. However, since corresponding angles are opposite, they are also equal.

aVIf a function f(x) is continuous on a closed interval [a, b], then f(x) has both a maximum and a minimum on [a, b]. If f(x) has an extremum on an open interval (a, b), then the extremum occurs at a critical point. This theorem is sometimes also called the Weierstrass extreme value theorem.\u000aThe standard proof of the first proceeds by noting that f is the continuous image of a compact set on the interval [a, b], so it must itself be compact. Since [a, b] is compact, it follows that the image f([a, b]) must also be compact.
p585
aVAn extremum is a maximum or minimum. An extremum may be local (a.k.a. a relative extremum; an extremum in a given region which is not the overall maximum or minimum) or global. Functions with many extrema can be very difficult to graph.\u000aNotorious examples include the functions cos(1/x) and sin(1/x) near x = 0, plotted above.\u000aAnother pathological example is sin(e^(2x + 9)) near 0 and 1, which has\u000a\u230ae^11/\u03c0 - 1/2\u230b - \u2308e^9/\u03c0 - 1/2\u2309 + 1 = 19058 - 2579 + 1 = 16480\u000aextrema in the closed interval [0, 1].

aVA factor is a portion of a quantity, usually an integer or polynomial that, when multiplied by other factors, gives the entire quantity. The determination of factors is called factorization (or sometimes "factoring").\u000aIn number theoretic usage, a factor of a number n is equivalent to a divisor of n. The divisors of a number n are given in the Wolfram Language by the command Divisors[n]. In elementary education, the term "factor" is sometimes used to mean proper divisor, i.e., a factor of n other than the number n itself. However, as a result of the confusion this practice creates and its inconsistency with the mathematical literature, it should be discouraged.

aVA field is any set of elements that satisfies the field axioms for both addition and multiplication and is a commutative division algebra. An archaic name for a field is rational domain. The French term for a field is corps and the German word is Körper, both meaning "body." A field with a finite number of members is known as a finite field or Galois field.\u000aBecause the identity condition is generally required to be different for addition and multiplication, every field must have at least two elements. Examples include the complex numbers (C), rational numbers (Q), and real numbers (R), but not the integers (Z), which form only a ring.
p607
aVThe field axioms are generally written in additive and multiplicative pairs.\u000aname | addition | multiplication\u000aassociativity | (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) | (ab) c = a(bc)\u000acommutativity | a + b = b + a | ab = ba\u000adistributivity | a(b + c) = ab + ac | (a + b) c = ac + bc\u000aidentity | a + 0 = a = 0 + a | a·1 = a = 1·a\u000ainverses | a + (-a) = 0 = (-a) + a | aa^(-1) = 1 = a^(-1) a if a!=0

aVA figurate number, also (but mostly in texts from the 1500 and 1600s) known as a figural number, is a number that can be represented by a regular geometrical arrangement of equally spaced points. If the arrangement forms a regular polygon, the number is called a polygonal number. The polygonal numbers illustrated above are called triangular, square, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers, respectively. Figurate numbers can also form other shapes such as centered polygons, L-shapes, three-dimensional solids, etc.

If A element F and A\u2286B\u2286S, then B element F \u000aIf S is an infinite set, then the collection F_S = {A\u2286S:S - A is finite} is a filter called the cofinite (or Fréchet) filter on S.

aVThe finite difference is the discrete analog of the derivative. The finite forward difference of a function f_p is defined as\u000a\u0394f_p congruent f_(p + 1) - f_p, and the finite backward difference as\u000a del f_p congruent f_p - f_(p - 1) .\u000aThe forward finite difference is implemented in the Wolfram Language as DifferenceDelta[f, i].
p612
aVA finite field is a field with a finite field order (i.e., number of elements), also called a Galois field. The order of a finite field is always a prime or a power of a prime (Birkhoff and Mac Lane 1996). For each prime power, there exists exactly one (with the usual caveat that "exactly one" means "exactly one up to an isomorphism") finite field GF(p^n), often written as F_p^n in current usage.
p613
aVA finite group is a group having finite group order. Examples of finite groups are the modulo multiplication groups, point groups, cyclic groups, dihedral groups, symmetric groups, alternating groups, and so on.\u000aProperties of finite groups are implemented in the Wolfram Language as FiniteGroupData[group, prop].\u000aThe classification theorem of finite groups states that the finite simple groups can be classified completely into one of five types.\u000aA convenient way to visualize groups is using so-called cycle graphs, which show the cycle structure of a given abstract group. For example, cycle graphs of the 5 nonisomorphic groups of order 8 are illustrated above.

aVLet the squares square ABCD and square AB' C' D' share a common polygon vertex A. The midpoints Q and S of the segments B' D and BD' together with the centers of the original squares R and T then form another square square QRST.

aVSteiner gave and Droz-Farny proved that if equal circles are drawn about the vertices of a triangle (dashed circles in the above figure), they cut the lines joining the midpoints of the corresponding sides in six points P_1, Q_1, P_2, Q_2, P_3, and Q_3, which lie on a circle whose center is the orthocenter. If the radius of these circles \u03c1 is the radius of the equal circles centered on the vertices A_1, A_2, and A_3, and R_H is the radius of the circle about H, then\u000aR_\u03c1^2 = 4R^2 + \u03c1^2 - 1/2(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2), where R is the circumradius of the reference triangle.

aVDraw lines P_A Q_A, P_B Q_B, and P_C Q_C through the symmedian point K and parallel to the sides of the triangle \u0394ABC. The points where the parallel lines intersect the sides of \u0394ABC then lie on a circle known as the first Lemoine circle, or sometimes the triplicate-ratio circle.
p618
aVThe first Morley triangle \u0394A' B' C', also simply known as "Morley's triangle", is the triangle constructed from pairwise intersections of the angle trisectors of a given triangle \u0394ABC. In particular, its A'-vertex is the point of intersection of the first trisector of B when swinging BC counterclockwise about B and the first trisector of C, with the B'- and C'-vertices similarly defined. By Morley's theorem, this triangle is equilateral.

aVThe set of terms of first-order logic (also known as first-order predicate calculus) is defined by the following rules: \u000a1. A variable is a term. \u000a2. If f is an n-place function symbol (with n>=0) and t_1, ..., t_n are terms, then f(t_1, ..., t_n) is a term. \u000aIf P is an n-place predicate symbol (again with n>=0) and t_1, ..., t_n are terms, then P(t_1, ..., t_n) is an atomic statement.

aVGiven five equal disks placed symmetrically about a given center, what is the smallest radius r for which the radius of the circular area covered by the five disks is 1? The answer is r = \u03d5 - 1 = 1/\u03d5 = 0.618034..., where \u03d5 is the golden ratio, and the centers c_i of the disks i = 1, ..., 5 are located at\u000ac_i = [1/\u03d5 cos((2\u03c0i)/5)\u000a1/\u03d5 sin((2\u03c0i)/5)].

aVA fixed point is a point that does not change upon application of a map, system of differential equations, etc. In particular, a fixed point of a function f(x) is a point x_0 such that\u000af(x_0) = x_0 .\u000aThe fixed point of a function f starting from an initial value x can be computed in the Wolfram Language using FixedPoint[f, x]. Similarly, to get a list of the values obtained by iterating the function until a fixed point is reached, the command FixedPointList[f, x] can be used.

aVAlthough the rigidity theorem states that if the faces of a convex polyhedron are made of metal plates and the polyhedron edges are replaced by hinges, the polyhedron would be rigid, concave polyhedra need not be rigid. A nonrigid polyhedron may be "shaky" (infinitesimally movable) or flexible (continuously movable; Wells 1991).

aVThere are many mathematical and recreational problems related to folding. Origami, the Japanese art of paper folding, is one well-known example.\u000aIt is possible to make a surprising variety of shapes by folding a piece of paper multiple times, making one complete straight cut, then unfolding. For example, a five-pointed star can be produced after four folds, as can a polygonal swan, butterfly, and angelfish. Amazingly, every polygonal shape can be produced this way, as can any disconnected combination of polygonal shapes. Furthermore, algorithms for determining the patterns of folds for a given shape have been devised by Bern et al. (2001) and Demaine et al. (1998, 1999).

aVPick any two relatively prime integers h and k, then the circle C(h, k) of radius 1/(2k^2) centered at (h/k, ± 1/(2k^2)) is known as a Ford circle. No matter what and how many hs and ks are picked, none of the Ford circles intersect (and all are tangent to the x-axis). This can be seen by examining the squared distance between the centers of the circles with (h, k) and (h', k'), d^2 = (h'/k' - h/k)^2 + (1/(2k^(, 2)) - 1/(2k^2))^2 .

aVFour-dimensional geometry is Euclidean geometry extended into one additional dimension. The prefix "hyper-" is usually used to refer to the four- (and higher-) dimensional analogs of three-dimensional objects, e.g., hypercube, hyperplane, hypersphere. n-dimensional polyhedra are called polytopes. The four-dimensional cases of general n-dimensional objects are often given special names, such as those summarized in the following table.

In this work, a = 0 and b = - 2\u03c0.
p634
aVA Fourier series is an expansion of a periodic function f(x) in terms of an infinite sum of sines and cosines. Fourier series make use of the orthogonality relationships of the sine and cosine functions. The computation and study of Fourier series is known as harmonic analysis and is extremely useful as a way to break up an arbitrary periodic function into a set of simple terms that can be plugged in, solved individually, and then recombined to obtain the solution to the original problem or an approximation to it to whatever accuracy is desired or practical. Examples of successive approximations to common functions using Fourier series are illustrated above.

aVIf f(x) is an odd function, then a_n = 0 and the Fourier series collapses to\u000af(x) = sum_(n = 1)^\u221e b_n sin(nx), where\u000ab_n | = | 1/\u03c0 integral_(-\u03c0)^\u03c0 f(x) sin(nx) dx\u000a | = | 2/\u03c0 integral_0^\u03c0 f(x) sin(nx) dx\u000afor n = 1, 2, 3, .... The last equality is true because\u000af(x) sin(nx) | = | [-f(-x)][-sin(-nx)]\u000a | = | f(-x) sin(-nx).

aVA fractal is an object or quantity that displays self-similarity, in a somewhat technical sense, on all scales. The object need not exhibit exactly the same structure at all scales, but the same "type" of structures must appear on all scales. A plot of the quantity on a log-log graph versus scale then gives a straight line, whose slope is said to be the fractal dimension. The prototypical example for a fractal is the length of a coastline measured with different length rulers. The shorter the ruler, the longer the length measured, a paradox known as the coastline paradox.\u000aIllustrated above are the fractals known as the Gosper island, Koch snowflake, box fractal, Sierpi\u0144ski sieve, Barnsley's fern, and Mandelbrot set.

aVThe study of an extension of derivatives and integrals to noninteger orders. Fractional calculus is based on the definition of the fractional integral as\u000aD^(-\u03bd) f(t) = 1/(\u0393(\u03bd)) integral_0^t (t - \u03be)^(\u03bd - 1) f(\u03be) d\u03be, where \u0393(\u03bd) is the gamma function. From this equation, fractional derivatives can also be defined.

aVThe fractional derivative of f(t) of order \u03bc>0 (if it exists) can be defined in terms of the fractional integral D^(-\u03bd) f(t) as\u000aD^\u03bc f(t) = D^m[D^(-(m - \u03bc)) f(t)], where m is an integer >=\u2308\u03bc\u2309, where \u2308x\u2309 is the ceiling function. The semiderivative corresponds to \u03bc = 1/2.
p640
aVThe function frac(x) giving the fractional (noninteger) part of a real number x. The symbol {x} is sometimes used instead of frac(x) (Graham et al. 1994, p. 70; Havil 2003, p. 109), but this notation is not used in this work due to possible confusion with the set containing the element x.\u000aUnfortunately, there is no universal agreement on the meaning of frac(x) for x<0 and there are two common definitions.

aVAn optical illusion named after British psychologist James Fraser, who first studied the illusion in 1908. The illusion is also known as the false spiral, or by its original name, the twisted cord illusion. While the image appears to be a spiral formed by a rope containing twisted strands of two different colors, it actually consists of concentric circles of twisted cords.\u000aThe visual distortion is produced by combining a regular line pattern (the circles) with misaligned parts (the differently colored strands). Zöllner's illusion and the café wall illusion are based on a similar principle, like many other visual effects, in which a sequence of tilted elements causes the eye to perceive phantom twists and deviations.

aVThe French metro metric is an example for disproving apparently intuitive but false properties of metric spaces. The metric consists of a distance function on the plane such that for all a, b element R^2, d(a, b) = { left bracketing bar a - b right bracketing bar | if a = cb for some c element R\u000a left bracketing bar a right bracketing bar + left bracketing bar b right bracketing bar | otherwise, auto right match \u000awhere left bracketing bar a right bracketing bar is the normal distance function on the plane. This metric has the property that for r< left bracketing bar a right bracketing bar , the open ball of radius r around a is an open line segment along vector a, while for r> left bracketing bar a right bracketing bar , the open ball is the union of a line segment and an open disk around the origin.

aVAlso known as the Serret-Frenet formulas, these vector differential equations relate inherent properties of a parametrized curve. In matrix form, they can be written\u000a[T^.\u000aN^.\u000aB^.] = [0 | \u03ba | 0\u000a-\u03ba | 0 | \u03c4\u000a0 | -\u03c4 | 0][T\u000aN\u000aB], where T is the unit tangent vector, N is the unit normal vector, B is the unit binormal vector, \u03c4 is the torsion, \u03ba is the curvature, and x^. denotes dx/ds.

aVIn general, a frieze consists of repeated copies of a single motif.\u000a | b | \u000aa | | d\u000a | c | \u000aConway and Guy define a frieze pattern as an arrangement of numbers at the intersection of two sets of perpendicular diagonals such that a + d = b + c + 1 (for an additive frieze pattern) or ad = bc + 1 (for a multiplicative frieze pattern) in each diamond.

aVThe Frobenius number is the largest value b for which the Frobenius equation\u000aa_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + ... + a_n x_n = b, has no solution, where the a_i are positive integers, b is an integer, and the solutions x_i are nonnegative integer. As an example, if the a_i values are 4 and 9, then 23 is the largest unsolvable number. Similarly, the largest number that is not a McNugget number (a number obtainable by adding multiples of 6, 9, and 20) is 43.\u000aFinding the Frobenius number of a given problem is known as the coin problem.

aVThe circumcircle of the Fuhrmann triangle. It has the line HNa, where H is the orthocenter and Na is the Nagel point, as its diameter. In fact, these points (Kimberling centers X_4 and X_8, respectively), are the only Kimberling centers lying on it.\u000aWhile H and Na are the only noteworthy triangle centers to lie on the circle, a total of at least six other noteworthy points lie on the Fuhrmann circle. Three of these are the points T, U, and V which are a distance 2r along the altitudes from the vertices, where r is the inradius of \u0394ABC.

aVA prime p for which 1/p has a maximal period decimal expansion of p - 1 digits. Full reptend primes are sometimes also called long primes (Conway and Guy 1996, pp. 157-163 and 166-171). There is a surprising connection between full reptend primes and Fermat primes.\u000aA prime p is full reptend iff 10 is a primitive root modulo p, which means that\u000a10^k congruent 1 (mod p)\u000afor k = p - 1 and no k less than this. In other words, the multiplicative order of p (mod 10) is p - 1. For example, 7 is a full reptend prime since (10^1, 10^2, 10^3, 10^4, 10^5, 10^6) congruent (3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1) (mod 7).
p652
aVA function is a relation that uniquely associates members of one set with members of another set. More formally, a function from A to B is an object f such that every a element A is uniquely associated with an object f(a) element B. A function is therefore a many-to-one (or sometimes one-to-one) relation. The set A of values at which a function is defined is called its domain, while the set f(A) subset B of values that the function can produce is called its range. Here, the set B is called the codomain of f.
p653
aVGiven a function f(x_1, ..., x_n) defined on a domain U, the graph of f is defined as the set of points (which often form a curve or surface) showing the values taken by f over U (or some portion of U). Technically, for real functions, graphf(x) | congruent | {(x, f(x)) element R^2 :x element U}\u000agraphf(x_1, ..., x_n) | congruent | {(x_1, ..., x_n, f(x_1, ..., x_n)) element R^(n + 1) :(x_1, ..., x_n) element U}.

aVLet G be a group and S be a topological G-set. Then a closed subset F of S is called a fundamental domain of G in S if S is the union of conjugates of F, i.e., S = union _(g element G) gF, and the intersection of any two conjugates has no interior.\u000aFor example, a fundamental domain of the group of rotations by multiples of 180° in R^2 is the upper half-plane {(x, y)|y>=0} and a fundamental domain of rotations by multiples of 90° is the first quadrant {(x, y)|x, y>=0}.

aVAn extension of two-valued logic such that statements need not be true or false, but may have a degree of truth between 0 and 1. Such a system can be extremely useful in designing control logic for real-world systems such as elevators.\u000aIn the Season 4 opening episode "Trust Metric" of the television crime drama NUMB3RS, math genius Charlie Eppes attempts to use fuzzy logic in an attempt to construct a trust metric telling how much fugitive and alleged traitor Colby Granger can be trusted.

Then G is a group of transformations of L, called the Galois group of L/K. The Galois group of L/K is denoted Gal(L/K) or Aut(L/K).

aVThe Galton board, also known as a quincunx or bean machine, is a device for statistical experiments named after English scientist Sir Francis Galton. It consists of an upright board with evenly spaced nails (or pegs) driven into its upper half, where the nails are arranged in staggered order, and a lower half divided into a number of evenly-spaced rectangular slots. The front of the device is covered with a glass cover to allow viewing of both nails and slots. In the middle of the upper edge, there is a funnel into which balls can be poured, where the diameter of the balls must be much smaller than the distance between the nails. The funnel is located precisely above the central nail of the second row so that each ball, if perfectly centered, would fall vertically and directly onto the uppermost point of this nail's surface. The figure above shows a variant of the board in which only the nails that can potentially be hit by a ball dropped from the funnel are included, leading to a triangular array instead of a rectangular one.\u000aEach time a ball hits one of the nails, it can bounce right (or left) with some probability p (and q = 1 - p). For symmetrically placed nails, balls will bounce left or right with equal probability, so p = q = 1/2. If the rows are numbered from 0 to N - 1, the path of each falling ball is a Bernoulli trial consisting of N steps. Each ball crosses the bottom row hitting the nth peg from the left (where 0<=n<=N - 1) iff it has taken exactly n right turns, which occurs with probability\u000aP_p(n|N) = (N\u000an) p^n q^(N - n) .\u000aThis process therefore gives rise to a binomial distribution of in the heights of heaps of balls in the lower slots.\u000aIf the number of balls is sufficiently large and p = q = 1/2, then according to the weak law of large numbers, the distribution of the heights of the ball heaps will approximate a normal distribution.\u000aSome care is needed to obtain these idealized results, however, as the actual distribution of balls depends on physical properties of the setup, including the elasticity of the balls (as characterized by their coefficient of restitution), the radius of the nails, and the offsets of the balls over the funnel's opening when they are dropped.

aVLet two players each have a finite number of pennies (say, n_1 for player one and n_2 for player two). Now, flip one of the pennies (from either player), with each player having 50% probability of winning, and transfer a penny from the loser to the winner. Now repeat the process until one player has all the pennies.\u000aIf the process is repeated indefinitely, the probability that one of the two player will eventually lose all his pennies must be 100%.

aVHex is a two-player game invented by Piet Hein in 1942 while a student at Niels Bohr's Institute for Theoretical Physics, and subsequently and independently by John Nash in 1948 while a mathematics graduate student at Princeton. The game was originally called Nash or John, with the latter name at the same time crediting its inventor and referring to the fact that it was frequently played on the tiled floors of bathrooms. The name Hex was invented in 1952, when a commercial version was issued by the game company Parker Brothers.

aVThe Game of Logic, described by Lewis Carroll--author of Alice in Wonderland--in 1887 consists of discussing the meaning of propositions like "Some fresh cakes are sweet, " and is an instructive introduction to the concepts of logic.\u000aThe game takes place in a world divided into four quadrants. In the northwest quadrant, the cakes are fresh and sweet, in the northeast, they are fresh and not-sweet, in the southwest, they are not-fresh and sweet, and in the southeast, they are not-fresh and not-sweet. The game is played with four red coins and five gray coins. A red coin is used to indicate the presence of some (one or more) cakes in a sector, while a gray coin indicates that the sector is empty.

aVGame theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the analysis of games (i.e., situations involving parties with conflicting interests). In addition to the mathematical elegance and complete "solution" which is possible for simple games, the principles of game theory also find applications to complicated games such as cards, checkers, and chess, as well as real-world problems as diverse as economics, property division, politics, and warfare.\u000aGame theory has two distinct branches: combinatorial game theory and classical game theory.

aVA gamma distribution is a general type of statistical distribution that is related to the beta distribution and arises naturally in processes for which the waiting times between Poisson distributed events are relevant.

aVGaussian curvature, sometimes also called total curvature, is an intrinsic property of a space independent of the coordinate system used to describe it. The Gaussian curvature of a regular surface in R^3 at a point p is formally defined as\u000aK(p) = det(S(p)), where S is the shape operator and det denotes the determinant.

aVA Gaussian integer is a complex number a + bi where a and b are integers. The Gaussian integers are members of the imaginary quadratic field Q(sqrt(-1)) and form a ring often denoted Z[i], or sometimes k(i). The sum, difference, and product of two Gaussian integers are Gaussian integers, but (a + bi)|(c + di) only if there is an e + fi such that\u000a(a + bi)(e + fi) = (ae - bf) + (af + be) i = c + di\u000a(Shanks 1993).\u000aGaussian integers can be uniquely factored in terms of other Gaussian integers (known as Gaussian primes) up to powers of i and rearrangements.

The fundamental theorem of Gaussian quadrature states that the optimal abscissas of the m-point Gaussian quadrature formulas are precisely the roots of the orthogonal polynomial for the same interval and weighting function. Gaussian quadrature is optimal because it fits all polynomials up to degree 2m - 1 exactly. Slightly less optimal fits are obtained from Radau quadrature and Laguerre-Gauss quadrature.

aVA ruled surface is called a generalized cylinder if it can be parameterized by x(u, v) = vp + y(u), where p is a fixed point. A generalized cylinder is a regular surface wherever y'×p!=0. The above surface is a generalized cylinder over a cardioid. A generalized cylinder is a flat surface, and is sometimes called a "cylindrical surface" or "cylinder surface".\u000aA generalized cylinder need not be closed.\u000aKern and Bland define a cylinder as a solid bounded by a generalized cylinder and two parallel planes. However, when used without qualification, the term "cylinder" generally refers to the particular case of a right circular cylinder.

aVThe generalized law of sines applies to a simplex in space of any dimension with constant Gaussian curvature. Let us work up to that. Initially in two-dimensional space, we define a generalized sine function for a one-dimensional simplex (line segment) with content (length) S in space of constant Gaussian curvature K as\u000agsinS = S - (KS^3)/(3!) + (K^2 S^5)/(5!) - (K^3 S^7)/(7!) + (K^4 S^9)/(9!) - (K^5 S^11)/(11!) + ....

aVA topologically invariant property of a surface defined as the largest number of nonintersecting simple closed curves that can be drawn on the surface without separating it. Roughly speaking, it is the number of holes in a surface.\u000aThe genus of a surface, also called the geometric genus, is related to the Euler characteristic \u03c7. For a orientable surface such as a sphere (genus 0) or torus (genus 1), the relationship is\u000a\u03c7 = 2 - 2g.
p682
aVA geodesic is a locally length-minimizing curve. Equivalently, it is a path that a particle which is not accelerating would follow. In the plane, the geodesics are straight lines. On the sphere, the geodesics are great circles (like the equator). The geodesics in a space depend on the Riemannian metric, which affects the notions of distance and acceleration.\u000aGeodesics preserve a direction on a surface and have many other interesting properties. The normal vector to any point of a geodesic arc lies along the normal to a surface at that point.

aVFor a unit speed curve on a surface, the length of the surface-tangential component of acceleration is the geodesic curvature \u03ba_g. Curves with \u03ba_g = 0 are called geodesics.

aVA geodesic dome is a triangulation of a Platonic solid or other polyhedron to produce a close approximation to a sphere (or hemisphere). The nth order geodesation operation replaces each polygon of the polyhedron by the projection onto the circumsphere of the order-n regular tessellation of that polygon.

aVA geometric sequence is a sequence {a_k}, k = 0, 1, ..., such that each term is given by a multiple r of the previous one. Another equivalent definition is that a sequence is geometric iff it has a zero series bias. If the multiplier is r, then the kth term is given by\u000aa_k = ra_(k - 1) = r^2 a_(k - 2) = a_0 r^k .\u000aTaking a_0 = 1 gives the simple special case\u000aa_k = r^k .\u000aThe Season 1 episode "Identity Crisis" of the television crime drama NUMB3RS mentions geometric progressions.

aVA geometric series sum_k a_k is a series for which the ratio of each two consecutive terms a_(k + 1)/a_k is a constant function of the summation index k. The more general case of the ratio a rational function of the summation index k produces a series called a hypergeometric series.\u000aFor the simplest case of the ratio a_(k + 1)/a_k = r equal to a constant r, the terms a_k are of the form a_k = a_0 r^k.

aVGeometry is the study of figures in a space of a given number of dimensions and of a given type. The most common types of geometry are plane geometry (dealing with objects like the point, line, circle, triangle, and polygon), solid geometry (dealing with objects like the line, sphere, and polyhedron), and spherical geometry (dealing with objects like the spherical triangle and spherical polygon). Geometry was part of the quadrivium taught in medieval universities.\u000aA mathematical pun notes that without geometry, life is pointless.

aVThe gnomonic projection is a nonconformal map projection obtained by projecting points P_1 (or P_2) on the surface of sphere from a sphere's center O to point P in a plane that is tangent to a point S. In the above figure, S is the south pole, but can in general be any point on the sphere. Since this projection obviously sends antipodal points P_1 and P_2 to the same point P in the plane, it can only be used to project one hemisphere at a time. In a gnomonic projection, great circles are mapped to straight lines. The gnomonic projection represents the image formed by a spherical lens, and is sometimes known as the rectilinear projection.

aVTuring machines are defined by sets of rules that operate on four parameters: (state, tape cell color, operation, state). Let the states and tape cell colors be numbered and represented by quadruples of ordinal numbers. Then there exist algorithmic procedures that sequentially list all consistent sets of Turing machine rules. A set of rules is called consistent if any two quadruples differ in the first or second element out of the four. Any such procedure gives both an algorithm for going from any integer to its corresponding Turing machine and an algorithm for getting the index of any consistent set of Turing machine rules.

aVA pair of primes (p, q) that sum to an even integer 2n = p + q are known as a Goldbach partition (Oliveira e Silva). Letting r(2n) denote the number of Goldbach partitions of 2n without regard to order, then the number of ways of writing 2n as a sum of two prime numbers taking the order of the two primes into account is\u000aR(2n) = {2r(2n) - 1 | for n prime\u000a2r(2n) | for n composite. auto right match \u000aThe Goldbach conjecture is then equivalent to the statement that r(n)>0 or, equivalently, that R(n)>0, for every even integer n>1.

aVThe oft-studied golden ratio \u03d5 has a number of equivalent definitions framed in a variety of different contexts. Historically, the golden ratio is defined to be the unique number x for which a rectangle of side ratio 1:x can be divided into a unit square and a separate rectangle whose side ratio is also 1:x, i.e., it is the division of a given length into two parts such that the ratio of the shorter to the longer equals the ratio of the longer part to the whole. Therefore, \u03d5 is the unique positive real number for which the identity\u000a\u03d5/1 = 1/(\u03d5 - 1).\u000aThe constant \u03d5 and its various properties have been studied since antiquity with various constructions attributed to Euclid and Pythogoras, among others.\u000aSimplifying the above identity, \u03d5 is thus the unique positive real number for which \u03d5^2 = \u03d5 + 1. Dividing both sides by \u03d5 yields \u03d5 = 1 + 1/\u03d5 and thereby yields a recursive definition of \u03d5 whose first few terms have the form\u000a\u03d5 = 1 + 1/\u03d5 = 1 + 1/(1 + 1/\u03d5) = 1 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/\u03d5))....\u000aAs this suggests, \u03d5 is the unique real number whose regular continued fraction has the form \u03d5 = [1;1, 1, 1, ...] or, in Gauss notation, \u03d5 = 1 + continued fraction k _(m=1)^\u221e 1/1.\u000aSolving the above equation algebraically yields the exact value of \u03d5, namely \u03d5 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 which, to fifty decimal places, is equal to\u000a\u03d5 = 1.6180339887498948482045868343656381177203091798058....\u000aIn addition to the above, one can find a vast number of connections between \u03d5 and the theory of continued fractions. For example, it is a well-known fact that {\u03d5^(n + 1)}_(n = -1)^\u221e and {\u03c8^(n + 1)}_(n = -1)^\u221e are both solutions to the three-term recurrence relation X_n = X_(n - 1) + X_(n - 2), n = 1, 2, 3, ..., where \u03d5 is as above and where \u03c8 = (1 - sqrt(5))/2 is the second solution of the equation x^2 - x - 1 = 0, and because {\u03d5^(n + 1)} and {\u03c8^(n + 1)} are C-linearly independent elements, they form a basis of the vector space L, the solution space of the recurrence relation above and a degree 2 vector space over C. Moreover, because the canonical partial numerators {A_n}_(n = 1)^\u221e, respectively partial denominators {B_n}_(n = 1)^\u221e, of an arbitrary continued fraction \u03be = continued fraction k _(n=1)^\u221e a_n/b_n are also elements of L, it follows that A_n and B_n are C-linear combinations of \u03d5^(n + 1) and \u03c8^(n + 1) for any arbitrary continued fraction \u03be = continued fraction k _(n=1)^\u221e a_n/b_n, n = 1, 2, 3, .... Among the significant ramifications of this are the so-called Binet's formula, as well as a multitude of significant literature in areas ranging from operator theory to algebraic field theory and beyond.

aVGiven a hereditary representation of a number n in base b, let B[b](n) be the nonnegative integer which results if we syntactically replace each b by b + 1 (i.e., B[b] is a base change operator that 'bumps the base' from b up to b + 1). The hereditary representation of 266 in base 2 is\u000a266 | = | 2^8 + 2^3 + 2\u000a | = | 2^(2^(2 + 1)) + 2^(2 + 1) + 2, so bumping the base from 2 to 3 yields\u000aB[2](266) = 3^(3^(3 + 1)) + 3^(3 + 1) + 3.

aVFor all n, there exists a k such that the kth term of the Goodstein sequence G_k(n) = 0. In other words, every Goodstein sequence converges to 0.\u000aThe secret underlying Goodstein's theorem is that the hereditary representation of n in base b mimics an ordinal notation for ordinals less than some number. For such ordinals, the base bumping operation leaves the ordinal fixed whereas the subtraction of one decreases the ordinal. But these ordinals are well ordered, and this allows us to conclude that a Goodstein sequence eventually converges to zero.

aVThe word "graph" has (at least) two meanings in mathematics.\u000aIn elementary mathematics, "graph" refers to a function graph or "graph of a function, " i.e., a plot.\u000aIn a mathematician's terminology, a graph is a collection of points and lines connecting some (possibly empty) subset of them. The points of a graph are most commonly known as graph vertices, but may also be called "nodes" or simply "points." Similarly, the lines connecting the vertices of a graph are most commonly known as graph edges, but may also be called "arcs" or "lines."
p718
aVAn automorphism of a graph is a graph isomorphism with itself, i.e., a mapping from the vertices of the given graph G back to vertices of G such that the resulting graph is isomorphic with G. The set of automorphisms defines a permutation group known as the graph's automorphism group. For every group \u0393, there exists a graph whose automorphism group is isomorphic to \u0393. The automorphism groups of a graph characterize its symmetries, and are therefore very useful in determining certain of its properties.

aVA bridge of a connected graph is a graph edge whose removal disconnects the graph. More generally, a bridge is an edge of a not-necessarily-connected graph G whose removal increases the number of components of G. An edge of a connected graph is a bridge iff it does not lie on any cycle.\u000aA bridge is also known as an isthmus, cut-edge, or cut arc.\u000aEvery edge of a tree is a bridge. A connected cubic graph contains a bridge iff it contains an articulation vertex, i.e., if it is not a biconnected graph.\u000aA graph containing one or more bridges is said to be a bridged graph, while a graph containing no bridges is called a bridgeless graph.

The graph sum G + G' on a n-node graph G is therefore the complete graph K_n, as illustrated above.\u000aA graph complement can be computed in the Wolfram Language by the command GraphComplement[g].
p721
aVGiven a "good" graph G (i.e., one for which all intersecting graph edges intersect in a single point and arise from four distinct graph vertices), the crossing number \u03bd(G), sometimes also denoted cr(G) (e.g., Pan and Richter 2007) or CR(G), is the minimum possible number of crossings with which the graph can be drawn, including using curved (non-rectilinear) edges. A graph with crossing number 0 is a planar graph. Garey and Johnson (1983ab) showed that determining the crossing number is an NP-complete problem.
p722
aVThe graph difference of graphs G and H is the graph with adjacency matrix given by the difference of adjacency matrices of G and H. A graph difference is defined when the orders of G and H are the same, and can be computed in the Wolfram Language using GraphDifference[g, h].
p723
aVFor an undirected graph, an unordered pair of nodes that specify a line joining these two nodes are said to form an edge. For a directed graph, the edge is an ordered pair of nodes. The terms "arc, " "branch, " "line, " "link, " and "1-simplex" are sometimes used instead of edge (e.g., Skiena 1990, p. 80; Harary 1994). Harary calls an edge of a graph a "line."\u000aThe following table lists the total number of edges in all graphs of given classes on n nodes.
p724
aVA graph embedding is a particular drawing of a graph. The above figure shows the first several circular embeddings of the cubical graph. The most commonly encountered graph embeddings are generally straight line drawings, in which all edges are drawn as straight line segments.\u000aWhile the underlying object is independent of the embedding, a clever choice of embedding can lead to particularly illuminating diagrams. For example, the circular (left) embedding of the cubical graph illustrates this graph's inherent symmetries.
p725
aVLet a tree S be a subgraph of a cubic graph G. The graph excision G\u2296S is the graph resulting from removing the tree, then merging the edges. For example, if in the Levi graph the tree formed by the 6 interior points (middle figure) is excised, the McGee graph results. Similarly, excising the Heawood graph gives the Petersen graph, and excising the generalized hexagon (i.e., the unique 12-cage graph) gives the Balaban 11-cage.\u000aThe reverse of excision is insertion. Both operations are used in the analysis of cages.\u000aThe following table gives some cubic symmetric graphs with named edge-excised graphs, illustrated above.
p726
aVThe genus of a graph is the minimum number of handles that must be added to the plane to embed the graph without any crossings. A planar graph therefore has graph genus 0.\u000aThe complete graph K_n has genus\u000a\u03b3(K_n) = \u2308((n - 3)(n - 4))/12\u2309\u000afor n>=3, where \u2308x\u2309 is the ceiling function. The values for n = 1, 2, ... are 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, ... (OEIS A000933).
p727
aVLet S be a set and F = {S_1, ..., S_p} a nonempty family of distinct nonempty subsets of S whose union is union _(i = 1)^p S_i = S. The intersection graph of F is denoted \u03a9(F) and defined by V(\u03a9(F)) = F, with S_i and S_j adjacent whenever i!=j and S_i intersection S_j !=\u2205. Then a graph G is an intersection graph on S if there exists a family F of subsets for which G and \u03a9(F) are isomorphic graphs. Graph intersections can be computed in the Wolfram Language using GraphIntersection[g, h].
p728
aVLet V(G) be the vertex set of a simple graph and E(G) its edge set. Then a graph isomorphism from a simple graph G to a simple graph H is a bijection f:V(G)->V(H) such that uv element E(G) iff f(u) f(v) element E(H).\u000aIf there is a graph isomorphism for G to H, then G is said to be isomorphic to H, written G\u2245H.\u000aThere exists no known P algorithm for graph isomorphism testing, although the problem has also not been shown to be NP-complete. As a result, the special complexity class graph isomorphism complete is sometimes used to refer to the problem of graph isomorphism testing.
p729
aVThe kth power of a graph G is a graph with the same set of vertices as G and an edge between two vertices iff there is a path of length at most k between them. Since a path of length two between vertices u and v exists for every vertex w such that {u, w} and {w, v} are edges in G, the square of the adjacency matrix of G counts the number of such paths. Similarly, the (u, v)th element of the kth power of the adjacency matrix of G gives the number of paths of length k between vertices u and v. Graph powers are implemented in the Wolfram Language as GraphPower[g, k].

aVThe union G = G_1 union G_2 of graphs G_1 and G_2 with disjoint point sets V_1 and V_2 and edge sets X_1 and X_2 is the graph with V = V_1 union V_2 and X = X_1 union X_2. This operation is sometimes also known explicitly as the graph disjoint union.\u000aGraph unions can be computed in the Wolfram Language using GraphDisjointUnion[g1, g2, ...]. (Note that the Wolfram Language function GraphUnion[g1, g2] performs a different operation from the usual graph union.)\u000aThe graph union of n copies of a graph G is commonly denoted nG.
p732
aV"Vertex" is a synonym for a node of a graph, i.e., one of the points on which the graph is defined and which may be connected by graph edges. The terms "point, " "junction, " and 0-simplex are also used.\u000aThe following tables gives the total numbers of graph vertices for various classes of graphs on n = 1, 2, ... nodes.
p733
aVA Gray code is an encoding of numbers so that adjacent numbers have a single digit differing by 1. The term Gray code is often used to refer to a "reflected" code, or more specifically still, the binary reflected Gray code.\u000aTo convert a binary number d_1 d_2 ...d_(n - 1) d_n to its corresponding binary reflected Gray code, start at the right with the digit d_n (the nth, or last, digit). If the d_(n - 1) is 1, replace d_n by 1 - d_n; otherwise, leave it unchanged. Then proceed to d_(n - 1). Continue up to the first digit d_1, which is kept the same since d_0 is assumed to be a 0. The resulting number g_1 g_2 ...g_(n - 1) g_n is the reflected binary Gray code.
p734
aVA great circle is a section of a sphere that contains a diameter of the sphere. Sections of the sphere that do not contain a diameter are called small circles. A great circle becomes a straight line in a gnomonic projection.\u000aThe shortest path between two points on a sphere, also known as an orthodrome, is a segment of a great circle.

aVThe great dodecahedron is the Kepler-Poinsot solid whose dual is the small stellated dodecahedron. It is also uniform polyhedron U_35 and Wenninger model W_20. Its Schläfli symbol is {5, 5/2}, and its Wythoff symbol is 5/2|25. It is concave, and consists of 12 intersecting pentagonal faces (12{5}).\u000aSchläfli did not recognize the great dodecahedron as a regular solid because it violates the polyhedral formula, instead satisfying\u000aN_0 - N_1 + N_2 = 12 - 30 + 12 = - 6, where N_0 is the number of vertices, N_1 the number of edges, and N_2 the number of faces.
p736
aVOne of the Kepler-Poinsot solids whose dual is the great stellated dodecahedron. It is also uniform polyhedron U_53, Wenninger model W_22, and has Schläfli symbol {3, 5/2} and Wythoff symbol 35/2|5/3.\u000aThe great icosahedron can be constructed from an icosahedron with unit edge lengths by taking the 20 sets of vertices that are mutually spaced by a distance \u03d5, the golden ratio. The solid therefore consists of 20 equilateral triangles. The symmetry of their arrangement is such that the resulting solid contains 12 pentagrams.
p737
aVThe 26-faced Archimedean solid A_3 consisting of faces 12{4} + 8{6} + 6{8}. It is sometimes (improperly) called the truncated cuboctahedron, and is also more properly called the rhombitruncated cuboctahedron. It is uniform polyhedron U_11 and Wenninger model W_15. It has Schläfli symbol t{3\u000a4} and Wythoff symbol 234|.\u000aThe great rhombicuboctahedron is an equilateral zonohedron and the Minkowski sum of three cubes. It can be combined with cubes and truncated octahedra into a regular space-filling pattern.

aVThe relationship between a line integral around a simple closed curve and a double integral over the plane region bounded by the curve, which may be stated as \u222e_dDf(x, y) dx + g(x, y) dy = integral integral_D(dg(x, y)/(dx) - df(x, y)/(dy)) dx dy.

aVA number\u000at_x = tan^(-1)(1/x) = cot^(-1) x, where x is an integer or rational number, tan^(-1) x is the inverse tangent, and cot^(-1) x is the inverse cotangent. Gregory numbers arise in the determination of Machin-like formulas. Every Gregory number t_x can be expressed uniquely as a linear combination of t_ns where the ns are Størmer numbers.
p741
aVThe Gregory series is a pi formula found by Gregory and Leibniz and obtained by plugging x = 1 into the Leibniz series, \u03c0/4 = sum_(k = 1)^\u221e (-1)^(k + 1)/(2k - 1) = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - ...\u000a(Wells 1986, p. 50). The formula converges very slowly, but its convergence can be accelerated using certain transformations, in particular\u000a\u03c0 = sum_(k = 1)^\u221e (3^k - 1)/4^k \u03b6(k + 1), where \u03b6(z) is the Riemann zeta function.
p742
aVA Gröbner basis G for a system of polynomials A is an equivalence system that possesses useful properties, for example, that another polynomial f is a combination of those in A iff the remainder of f with respect to G is 0. (Here, the division algorithm requires an order of a certain type on the monomials.) Furthermore, the set of polynomials in a Gröbner basis have the same collection of roots as the original polynomials. For linear functions in any number of variables, a Gröbner basis is equivalent to Gaussian elimination.\u000aThe algorithm for computing Gröbner bases is known as Buchberger's algorithm. Calculating a Gröbner basis is typically a very time-consuming process for large polynomial systems.
p743
aVA group G is a finite or infinite set of elements together with a binary operation (called the group operation) that together satisfy the four fundamental properties of closure, associativity, the identity property, and the inverse property. The operation with respect to which a group is defined is often called the "group operation, " and a set is said to be a group "under" this operation. Elements A, B, C, ... with binary operation between A and B denoted AB form a group if \u000a1. Closure: If A and B are two elements in G, then the product AB is also in G. \u000a2. Associativity: The defined multiplication is associative, i.e., for all A, B, C element G, (AB) C = A(BC).
p744
aVA set of generators (g_1, ..., g_n) is a set of group elements such that possibly repeated application of the generators on themselves and each other is capable of producing all the elements in the group. Cyclic groups can be generated as powers of a single generator. Two elements of a dihedral group that do not have the same sign of ordering are generators for the entire group.\u000aThe Cayley graph of a group G and a subset of elements (excluding the identity element) is connected iff the subset generates the group.
p745
aVIn celestial mechanics, the fixed path a planet traces as it moves around the sun is called an orbit. When a group G acts on a set X (this process is called a group action), it permutes the elements of X. Any particular element X moves around in a fixed path which is called its orbit. In the notation of set theory, the group orbit of a group element x can be defined as\u000aG(x) = {gx element X:g element G}, where g runs over all elements of the group G. For example, for the permutation group G_1 = {(1234), (2134), (1243), (2143)}, the orbits of 1 and 2 are {1, 2} and the orbits of 3 and 4 are {3, 4}.
p746
aVA representation of a group G is a group action of G on a vector space V by invertible linear maps. For example, the group of two elements Z_2 = {0, 1} has a representation \u03d5 by \u03d5(0) v = v and \u03d5(1) v = - v. A representation is a group homomorphism \u03d5:G->GL(V).\u000aMost groups have many different representations, possibly on different vector spaces.
p747
aVThe study of groups. Gauss developed but did not publish parts of the mathematics of group theory, but Galois is generally considered to have been the first to develop the theory. Group theory is a powerful formal method for analyzing abstract and physical systems in which symmetry is present and has surprising importance in physics, especially quantum mechanics.

aVGuilloché patterns are spirograph-like curves that frame a curve within an inner and outer envelope curve. They are used on banknotes, securities, and passports worldwide for added security against counterfeiting. For currency, the precise techniques used by the governments of Russia, the United States, Brazil, the European Union, Madagascar, Egypt, and all other countries are likely quite different. The figures above show the same guilloche pattern plotted in polar and Cartesian coordinates generated by a series of nested additions and multiplications of sinusoids of various periods.

aVThere are essentially three types of Fisher-Tippett extreme value distributions. The most common is the type I distribution, which are sometimes referred to as Gumbel types or just Gumbel distributions. These are distributions of an extreme order statistic for a distribution of N elements X_i. In this work, the term "Gumbel distribution" is used to refer to the distribution corresponding to a minimum extreme value distribution (i.e., the distribution of the minimum X^(\u23291\u232a)).\u000aThe Gumbel distribution with location parameter \u03b1 and scale parameter \u03b2 is implemented in the Wolfram Language as GumbelDistribution[alpha, beta].

aVWith three cuts, dissect an equilateral triangle into a square. The problem was first proposed by Dudeney in 1902, and subsequently discussed in Dudeney, and Gardner, Stewart, and Wells. The solution can be hinged so that the four pieces collapse into either the triangle or the square. Two of the hinges bisect sides of the triangle, while the third hinge and the corner of the large piece on the base cut the base in the approximate ratio 0.982:2:1.018.

aVSequences of integers generated in the Collatz problem. For example, for a starting number of 7, the sequence is 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, .... Such sequences are called hailstone sequences because the values typically rise and fall, somewhat analogously to a hailstone inside a cloud.\u000aWhile a hailstone eventually becomes so heavy that it falls to ground, every starting positive integer ever tested has produced a hailstone sequence that eventually drops down to the number 1 and then "bounces" into the small loop 4, 2, 1, ....

aVA half-space is that portion of an n-dimensional space obtained by removing that part lying on one side of an (n - 1)-dimensional hyperplane. For example, half a Euclidean space is given by the three-dimensional region satisfying x>0, -\u221e<y<\u221e, -\u221e<z<\u221e, while a half-plane is given by the two-dimensional region satisfying x>0, -\u221e<y<\u221e.

aVA Hamiltonian cycle, also called a Hamiltonian circuit, Hamilton cycle, or Hamilton circuit, is a graph cycle (i.e., closed loop) through a graph that visits each node exactly once. A graph possessing a Hamiltonian cycle is said to be a Hamiltonian graph. By convention, the singleton graph K_1 is considered to be Hamiltonian even though it does not posses a Hamiltonian cycle, while the connected graph on two nodes K_2 is not.\u000aThe Hamiltonian cycle is named after Sir William Rowan Hamilton, who devised a puzzle in which such a path along the polyhedron edges of an dodecahedron was sought (the Icosian game).

aVAn apodization function, also called the Hann function, frequently used to reduce leakage in discrete Fourier transforms. The illustrations above show the Hanning function, its instrument function, and a blowup of the instrument function sidelobes. It is named after the Austrian meteorologist Julius von Hann (Blackman and Tukey 1959, pp. 98-99). The Hanning function is given by\u000aA(x) | = | cos^2((\u03c0x)/(2a))\u000a | = | 1/2[1 + cos((\u03c0x)/a)].\u000aIts full width at half maximum is a.

aVThe word "harmonic" has several distinct meanings in mathematics, none of which is obviously related to the others. Simple harmonic motion or "harmonic oscillation" refers to oscillations with a sinusoidal waveform. Such functions satisfy the differential equation\u000a(d^2 x)/(dt^2) + \u03c9^2 x = 0, which has solution\u000ax = Acos(\u03c9t + \u03d5_1) + Bsin(\u03c9t + \u03d5_2).\u000aThe word harmonic analysis is therefore used to describe Fourier series, which breaks an arbitrary function into a superposition of sinusoids.

aVIn music, if a note has frequency f, integer multiples of that frequency, 2f, 3f, 4f and so on, are known as harmonics. As a result, the mathematical study of overlapping waves is called harmonic analysis.\u000aHarmonic analysis is a diverse field including such branches as Fourier series, isospectral manifolds (hearing the shape of a drum), and topological groups.

p769
aVAny real function u(x, y) with continuous second partial derivatives which satisfies Laplace's equation, del ^2 u(x, y) = 0, is called a harmonic function. Harmonic functions are called potential functions in physics and engineering. Potential functions are extremely useful, for example, in electromagnetism, where they reduce the study of a 3-component vector field to a 1-component scalar function. A scalar harmonic function is called a scalar potential, and a vector harmonic function is called a vector potential.

aVA harmonic number is a number of the form\u000aH_n = sum_(k = 1)^n 1/k\u000aarising from truncation of the harmonic series. A harmonic number can be expressed analytically as\u000aH_n = \u03b3 + \u03c8_0(n + 1), where \u03b3 is the Euler-Mascheroni constant and \u03a8(x) = \u03c8_0(x) is the digamma function.

The divergence, however, is very slow. Divergence of the harmonic series was first demonstrated by Nicole d'Oresme (ca. 1323-1382), but was mislaid for several centuries (Havil 2003, p. 23; Derbyshire 2004, pp. 9-10). The result was proved again by Pietro Mengoli in 1647, by Johann Bernoulli in 1687, and by Jakob Bernoulli shortly thereafter.

The resulting motion can produce beautiful, complicated curves which eventually terminate in a point as the motion of the pendula is damped by friction.

aVThe (circular) helicoid is the minimal surface having a (circular) helix as its boundary. It is the only ruled minimal surface other than the plane (Catalan 1842, do Carmo 1986). For many years, the helicoid remained the only known example of a complete embedded minimal surface of finite topology with infinite curvature. However, in 1992 a second example, known as Hoffman's minimal surface and consisting of a helicoid with a hole, was discovered (Sci. News 1992). The helicoid is the only non-rotary surface which can glide along itself.\u000aThe equation of a helicoid in cylindrical coordinates is\u000az = c\u03b8.
p787
aVA helix, sometimes also called a coil, is a curve for which the tangent makes a constant angle with a fixed line. The shortest path between two points on a cylinder (one not directly above the other) is a fractional turn of a helix, as can be seen by cutting the cylinder along one of its sides, flattening it out, and noting that a straight line connecting the points becomes helical upon re-wrapping. It is for this reason that squirrels chasing one another up and around tree trunks follow helical paths.

aVAn optical illusion due to the physiologist Ewald Hering in 1861. The two horizontal lines are both straight, but they look as if they were bowed outwards.

aVA square matrix is called Hermitian if it is self-adjoint. Therefore, a Hermitian matrix A = (a_(ij)) is defined as one for which\u000aA = A^H, where A^H denotes the conjugate transpose. This is equivalent to the condition\u000aa_(ij) = a^__(ji), where z^_ denotes the complex conjugate. As a result of this definition, the diagonal elements a_(ii) of a Hermitian matrix are real numbers (since a_(ii) = a^__(ii)), while other elements may be complex.

As shown in Sturm-Liouville theory, if L^~ is self-adjoint and satisfies the boundary conditions\u000av^_ pu' |_(x = a) = v^_ pu' |_(x = b), then it is automatically Hermitian.

Taking a collection of 13 such spheres gives the cluster illustrated above.

aVA lossless data compression algorithm which uses a small number of bits to encode common characters. Huffman coding approximates the probability for each character as a power of 1/2 to avoid complications associated with using a nonintegral number of bits to encode characters using their actual probabilities.\u000aHuffman coding works on a list of weights {w_i} by building an extended binary tree with minimum weighted external path length and proceeds by finding the two smallest ws, w_1 and w_2, viewed as external nodes, and replacing them with an internal node of weight w_1 + w_2. The procedure is them repeated stepwise until the root node is reached. An individual external node can then be encoded by a binary string of 0s (for left branches) and 1s (for right branches).

aVIn two dimensions, there are two periodic circle packings for identical circles: square lattice and hexagonal lattice. In 1940, Fejes Tóth proved that the hexagonal lattice is the densest of all possible plane packings (Conway and Sloane 1993, pp. 8-9).\u000aThe analog of face-centered cubic packing is the densest lattice packing in four and five dimensions. In eight dimensions, the densest lattice packing is made up of two copies of face-centered cubic. In six and seven dimensions, the densest lattice packings are cross sections of the eight-dimensional case. In 24 dimensions, the densest packing appears to be the Leech lattice. For high dimensions (~1000-D), the densest known packings are nonlattice.

aVThe icosahedral group I_h is the point group of symmetries of the icosahedron and dodecahedron having order 120, equivalent to the group direct product A_5×Z_2 of the alternating group A_5 and cyclic group Z_2. The icosahedral group consists of the conjugacy classes 1, 12C_5, 12C_5^2, 20C_3, 15C_2, i, 12S_10, 12S_10^3, 20S_6, and 15\u03c3. Its multiplication table is illustrated above.

aVThe (general) icosahedron is a 20-faced polyhedron (where icos- derives from the Greek word for "twenty" and -hedron comes from the Indo-European word for "seat").

aVRadial line segments whose inward-pointing end produce the illusion of a circle or other figure. The apparent figure has the same color as the background, but appears brighter. A similar effect is obtained in the Kanizsa triangle.\u000aThe contour illusion above is sometimes known as the Ehrenstein illusion.

aVAlthough Descartes originally used the term "imaginary number" to refer to what is today known as a complex number, in standard usage today, "imaginary number" means a complex number z that has zero real part (i.e., such that \u211c[z] = 0). For clarity, such numbers are perhaps best referred to as purely imaginary numbers.\u000aA (purely) imaginary number can be written as a real number multiplied by the "imaginary unit" i (equal to the square root sqrt(-1)), i.e., in the form z = iy.
p867
aVThe imaginary number i = sqrt(-1), i.e., the square root of -1. The imaginary unit is denoted and commonly referred to as "i." Although there are two possible square roots of any number, the square roots of a negative number cannot be distinguished until one of the two is defined as the imaginary unit, at which point +i and -i can then be distinguished. Since either choice is possible, there is no ambiguity in defining i as "the" square root of -1. In the Wolfram Language, the imaginary unit is implemented as I.

aVThe incenter I is the center of the incircle for a polygon or insphere for a polyhedron (when they exist). The corresponding radius of the incircle or insphere is known as the inradius.\u000aThe incenter can be constructed as the intersection of angle bisectors. It is also the interior point for which distances to the sides of the triangle are equal. It has trilinear coordinates 1:1:1, i.e., triangle center function\u000a\u03b1_1 = 1, and homogeneous barycentric coordinates (a, b, c). It is Kimberling center X_1.
p873
aVGiven a triangle \u0394A_1 A_2 A_3, the points A_1, I, and J_1 lie on a line, where I is the incenter and J_1 is the excenter corresponding to A_1. Furthermore, the circle with IJ_1 as the diameter has P as its center, where P is the intersection of A_1 J_1 with the circumcircle of \u0394A_1 A_2 A_3, and passes through A_2 and A_3. This circle has radius\u000ar = 1/2 a_1 sec(1/2 \u03b1_1) = 2Rsin(1/2 \u03b1_1).\u000aIt arises because IJ_1 J_2 J_3 forms an orthocentric system.

aVThe incentral triangle \u0394I_A I_B I_C is the Cevian triangle of a triangle \u0394ABC with respect to its incenter I. It is therefore also the triangle whose vertices are determined by the intersections of the reference triangle's angle bisectors with the respective opposite sides.\u000aIts trilinear vertex matrix is\u000a[0 | 1 | 1\u000a1 | 0 | 1\u000a1 | 1 | 0].\u000aIt is perspective to every anticevian triangle.\u000aIt is the cyclocevian triangle with respect to Kimberling center X_1029.

aVThe incidence matrix of a graph gives the (0, 1)-matrix which has a row for each vertex and column for each edge, and (v, e) = 1 iff vertex v is incident upon edge e. However, some authors define the incidence matrix to be the transpose of this, with a column for each vertex and a row for each edge. The physicist Kirchhoff was the first to define the incidence matrix.\u000aThe incidence matrix of a graph (using the first definition) can be computed in the Wolfram Language using IncidenceMatrix[g]. Precomputed incidence matrices for a many named graphs are given in the Wolfram Language by GraphData[graph, IncidenceMatrix].
p876
aVAn incircle is an inscribed circle of a polygon, i.e., a circle that is tangent to each of the polygon's sides. The center I of the incircle is called the incenter, and the radius r of the circle is called the inradius.\u000aWhile an incircle does not necessarily exist for arbitrary polygons, it exists and is moreover unique for triangles, regular polygons, and some other polygons including rhombi, bicentric polygons, and tangential quadrilaterals.

aVA statistic which assigns a single number to several individual statistics in order to quantify trends. The best-known index in the United States is the consumer price index, which gives a sort of "average" value for inflation based on price changes for a group of selected products. The Dow Jones and NASDAQ indexes for the New York and American Stock Exchanges, respectively, are also index numbers.\u000aLet p_n be the price per unit in period n, q_n be the quantity produced in period n, and v_n congruent p_n q_n be the value of the n units. Let q_a be the estimated relative importance of a product. There are several types of indices defined, among them those listed in the following table.

aNaVAn inflection point is a point on a curve at which the sign of the curvature (i.e., the concavity) changes. Inflection points may be stationary points, but are not local maxima or local minima. For example, for the curve y = x^3 plotted above, the point x = 0 is an inflection point.\u000aThe first derivative test can sometimes distinguish inflection points from extrema for differentiable functions f(x).\u000aThe second derivative test is also useful. A necessary condition for x to be an inflection point is f''(x) = 0. A sufficient condition requires f''(x + \u03f5) and f''(x - \u03f5) to have opposite signs in the neighborhood of x.

aVLet f be a function defined on a set A and taking values in a set B. Then f is said to be an injection (or injective map, or embedding) if, whenever f(x) = f(y), it must be the case that x = y. Equivalently, x!=y implies f(x)!=f(y). In other words, f is an injection if it maps distinct objects to distinct objects. An injection is sometimes also called one-to-one.\u000aA linear transformation is injective if the kernel of the function is zero, i.e., a function f(x) is injective iff Ker(f) = 0.\u000aA function which is both an injection and a surjection is said to be a bijection.

A given integer n may be negative (n element Z^-), nonnegative (n element Z^*), zero (n = 0), or positive (n element Z^+ = N). The set of integers is, not surprisingly, called Integers in the Wolfram Language, and a number x can be tested to see if it is a member of the integers using the command Element[x, Integers].

An integer polynomial gives integer values for all integer arguments of x. The set of integer polynomials is denoted Z[x]. Integer polynomials are sometimes also called "integral polynomials, " although this usage should be deprecated due to its confusing use of the term "integral" as an adjective.\u000aAn integer polynomial is called primitive if the greatest common divisor (a_0, a_1, ..., a_n) = 1.

aVAn integral is a mathematical object that can be interpreted as an area or a generalization of area. Integrals, together with derivatives, are the fundamental objects of calculus. Other words for integral include antiderivative and primitive. The Riemann integral is the simplest integral definition and the only one usually encountered in physics and elementary calculus. In fact, according to Jeffreys and Jeffreys, "it appears that cases where these methods [i.e., generalizations of the Riemann integral] are applicable and Riemann's [definition of the integral] is not are too rare in physics to repay the extra difficulty."

In general, this technique involves the construction of a function L(x) called the interpolant which agrees with f at the points x = x_i and which is then used to compute the desired values.

The intersection of sets A_1 through A_n is written intersection _(i = 1)^n A_i.\u000aThe intersection of two lines AB and CD is written AB intersection CD. The intersection of two or more geometric objects is the point (points, lines, etc.) at which they concur.

aVAn interval is a connected portion of the real line. If the endpoints a and b are finite and are included, the interval is called closed and is denoted [a, b]. If the endpoints are not included, the interval is called open and denoted (a, b). If one endpoint is included but not the other, the interval is denoted [a, b) or (a, b] and is called a half-closed (or half-open interval).\u000aAn interval [a, a] is called a degenerate interval.

aVInterval arithmetic is the arithmetic of quantities that lie within specified ranges (i.e., intervals) instead of having definite known values. Interval arithmetic can be especially useful when working with data that is subject to measurement errors or uncertainties. It can be considered a rigorous version of significance arithmetic (a.k.a., automatic precision control).\u000aIt is powerful enough to provide rigorous mathematical proofs (de la Llave 1991, Hutchings et al. 2000, Tucker 2002, Gutowski 2003), but rigor comes at a price. In particular, interval arithmetic can be slow, and often gives overly pessimistic results for real-world computations.

A graph is intrinsically linked iff it contains one of the seven Petersen graphs .\u000aThe complete graph K_6 (left) is intrinsically linked because it contains at least two linked triangles.

aVInversion is the process of transforming points P to a corresponding set of points P' known as their inverse points. Two points P and P' are said to be inverses with respect to an inversion circle having inversion center O = (x_0, y_0) and inversion radius k if P' is the perpendicular foot of the altitude of \u0394OQP, where Q is a point on the circle such that OQ\u22a5PQ.\u000aThe analogous notation of inversion can be performed in three-dimensional space with respect to an inversion sphere.

aVAttach a string to a point on a curve. Extend the string so that it is tangent to the curve at the point of attachment. Then wind the string up, keeping it always taut. The locus of points traced out by the end of the string is called the involute of the original curve, and the original curve is called the evolute of its involute. This process is illustrated above for a circle.\u000aAlthough a curve has a unique evolute, it has infinitely many involutes corresponding to different choices of initial point. An involute can also be thought of as any curve orthogonal to all the tangents to a given curve.

aVAn irrational number is a number that cannot be expressed as a fraction p/q for any integers p and q. Irrational numbers have decimal expansions that neither terminate nor become periodic. Every transcendental number is irrational.\u000aThere is no standard notation for the set of irrational numbers, but the notations Q^_, R - Q, or R\u005cQ, where the bar, minus sign, or backslash indicates the set complement of the rational numbers Q over the reals R, could all be used.
p918
aVAn irreducible fraction is a fraction p/q for which GCD(p, q) = 1, i.e., p and q are relatively prime. For example, in the complex plane, (4 + 7i)/(2 + i) = 3 + 2i is reducible, while (5 + 5i)/(7 + i) = 4/5 + 3i/5 is not.\u000aThe figure above shows the irreducible fractions plotted in the complex plane.

aVA polynomial is said to be irreducible if it cannot be factored into nontrivial polynomials over the same field.\u000aFor example, in the field of rational polynomials Q[x] (i.e., polynomials f(x) with rational coefficients), f(x) is said to be irreducible if there do not exist two nonconstant polynomials g(x) and h(x) in x with rational coefficients such that\u000af(x) = g(x) h(x)\u000a(Nagell 1951, p. 160). Similarly, in the finite field GF(2), x^2 + x + 1 is irreducible, but x^2 + 1 is not, since (x + 1)(x + 1) = x^2 + 2x + 1 congruent x^2 + 1 (mod 2).

aVA metric space X is isometric to a metric space Y if there is a bijection f between X and Y that preserves distances. That is, d(a, b) = d(f(a), f(b)). In the context of Riemannian geometry, two manifolds M and N are isometric if there is a diffeomorphism such that the Riemannian metric from one pulls back to the metric on the other. Since the geodesics define a distance, a Riemannian metric makes the manifold M a metric space. An isometry between Riemannian manifolds is also an isometry between the two manifolds, considered as metric spaces.
p925
aVA bijective map between two metric spaces that preserves distances, i.e., d(f(x), f(y)) = d(x, y), where f is the map and d(a, b) is the distance function. Isometries are sometimes also called congruence transformations. Two figures that can be transformed into each other by an isometry are said to be congruent.\u000aAn isometry of the plane is a linear transformation which preserves length. Isometries include rotation, translation, reflection, glides, and the identity map. Two geometric figures related by an isometry are said to be geometrically congruent.

aVLet three equal circles with centers J_A, J_B, and J_C intersect in a single point H and intersect pairwise in the points A, B, and C. Then the circumcircle O of the reference triangle \u0394ABC is congruent to the original three.\u000aFurthermore, the points H, A, B, and C form an orthocentric system.\u000aHere, the original three circles are known as Johnson circles and the triangle \u0394J_A J_B J_C formed by their centers is known as the Johnson triangle. Amazingly, the Johnson triangle circumcircle is also congruent to the circumcircle of the reference triangle and centered at the orthocenter H.

aVGiven a group of n men arranged in a circle under the edict that every mth man will be executed going around the circle until only one remains, find the position L(n, m) in which you should stand in order to be the last survivor. The list giving the place in the execution sequence of the first, second, etc. man can be given by Josephus[n, m] in the Wolfram Language package Combinatorica \u0300 . For example, consider n = 4 men numbered 1 to 4 such that each second (m = 2) man is iteratively slaughtered, as illustrated above. As can be seen, the first man is slaughtered 4th, the second man 1st, the third man 3rd, and the fourth man 2nd, so Josephus[4, 2] returns {4, 1, 3, 2}.

aVThe Kaprekar routine is an algorithm discovered in 1949 by D. R. Kaprekar for 4-digit numbers, but which can be generalized to k-digit numbers. To apply the Kaprekar routine to a number n, arrange the digits in descending (n') and ascending (n'') order. Now compute K(n) congruent n' - n'' (discarding any initial 0s) and iterate, where K(n) is sometimes called the Kaprekar function. The algorithm reaches 0 (a degenerate case), a constant, or a cycle, depending on the number of digits in k and the value of n. The list of values is sometimes called a Kaprekar sequence, and the result K(n) is sometimes called a Kaprekar number, though this nomenclature should be deprecated because of confusing with the distinct sort of Kaprekar number.\u000aIn base-10, the numbers n for which K(n) = n are given by 495, 6174, 549945, 631764, ... (OEIS A099009). Similarly, the numbers n for which iterating K(n) gives a cycle of length k>=2 are given by 53955, 59994, 61974, 62964, 63954, 71973, ... (OEIS A099010).\u000aIterating the Kaprekar map in base-10, all 1- and 2-digit numbers give 0. Exactly 60 3-digit numbers, namely 100, 101, 110, 111, 112, 121, 122, 211, 212, 221, ... (OEIS A090429), reach 0, while the rest give 495 in at most 6 iterations. Exactly 77 4-digit numbers, namely 1000, 1011, 1101, 1110, 1111, 1112, 1121, 1211, ... (OEIS A069746), reach 0, while the remainder give 6174 in at most 8 iterations. The value 6174 is sometimes known as Kaprekar's constant. This pattern breaks down for 5-digit numbers, which may converge to 0 or one of the 10 constants 53955, 59994, 61974, 62964, 63954, 71973, 74943, 75933, 82962, 83952.\u000aThe following table summarizes the possible cycles in various bases b and the first few numbers of digits.\u000ab | possible cycles for d = 1, 2, ... base-b digits\u000a2 | 0, 0, 9, 21, {(45), (49)}, ...\u000a3 | 0, 0, (32, 52), 184, (320, 580, 484), ...\u000a4 | 0, 30, {201, (126, 138)}, (570, 765), {(2550), , }, ...\u000a5 | 8, (48, 72), 392, (1992, 2616, 2856, 2232), (7488, 10712, 9992, 13736, 11432), ...\u000a6 | 0, 105, (430, 890, 920, 675, 860, 705), {5600, (4305, 5180)}, {(27195), (33860), (42925), (16840, 42745, 35510)}, ...\u000a7 | 0, (144, 192), (1068, 1752, 1836), (9936, 15072, 13680, 13008, 10608), (55500, 89112, 91800, 72012, 91212, 77388), ...\u000a8 | 21, 252, {(1589, 3178, 2723), (1022, 3122, 3290, 2044, 2212)}, {(17892, 20475), (21483, 25578, 26586, 21987)}, ...\u000a9 | (16, 48), (320, 400), {(2256, 5312, 3856), (3712, 5168, 5456)}, {41520, (34960, 40080, 55360, 49520, 42240)}, ...\u000a10 | 0, 495, 6174, {(53955, 59994), (61974, 82962, 75933, 63954), (62964, 71973, 83952, 74943)}, ...\u000aThe figure above (similar to that appearing on the cover of the above issue of The Mathematics Teacher) shows the number of steps required for the Kaprekar routine to reach a fixed point for values of n = 0 to 9999, partitioned into rows of length 100. In this plot, numbers having fewer than 4 digits are padded with leading 0s, thus resulting in all values converging to 6174.

It was proposed to explain the rapid rise and fall in the number of infected patients observed in epidemics such as the plague (London 1665-1666, Bombay 1906) and cholera. It assumes that the population size is fixed (i.e., no births, deaths due to disease, or deaths by natural causes), incubation period of the infectious agent is instantaneous, and duration of infectivity is same as length of the disease. It also assumes a completely homogeneous population with no age, spatial, or social structure.

aVNamed for its discoverer, Khinchin's is a constant is a real number K defined to be the almost-everywhere asymptotic bound of the geometric means of the partial quotients of an arbitrary real number. Said differently, given a real number x with corresponding regular continued fraction \u03be = [b_0 ;b_1, b_2, ...], let G_n(x) denote the geometric mean of the first n partial quotients of \u03be, i.e., G_n(x) = (b_1·b_2 ...b_n)^(1/n) .\u000aKhinchin proved that for almost all x element R, lim_(n->\u221e) G_n(x) = K\u000awhere K is a constant independent of n or x. It is unknown currently whether Khinchin's constant K is irrational or transcendental, though to 50 decimal places, K can be computed to equal\u000aK = 2.6854520010653064453097148354817956938203822939945....\u000aMoreover, while it is known that nearly every real number has a regular continued fraction, the geometric mean of whose partial quotients approach K asymptotically, no such x element R has been exhibited; on the other hand, several significant real numbers have been shown to have regular continued fractions which do not approach K, among which are x = e, x = sqrt(2), x = sqrt(3), and x = \u03d5, where \u03d5 denotes the golden ratio. The regular continued fraction of K starts out K = [2;1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, ...].\u000aKhinchin's derivation of the above-mentioned result is actually a corollary deduced from the proof of a much stronger result. In particular, he showed that if f(r) is a nonnegative function defined on all r element Z^+ and if there exist positive constants C and \u03b4 for which f(r)<Cr^(-\u03b4) sqrt(r), r = 1, 2, ..., then for almost all real numbers x element (0, 1) with associated regular continued fraction \u03be = [0;b_1, b_2, ...], lim_(n->\u221e) 1/n sum_(k = 1)^n f(b_k) = sum_(r = 1)^\u221e f(r)/(ln2) ln(1 + 1/r(r + 2)).\u000aFrom this more general statement, Khinchin's constant can be derived by defining f(r) = lnr, whereby the above equation can be rewritten as\u000alim_(n->\u221e) (b_1·b_2 ...b_n)^(1/n) = product_(r = 1)^\u221e (1 + 1/r(r + 2))^(lnr/ln2), where the infinite product converges to K almost everywhere. As Khinchin himself notes, the phrasing of the original result is general enough to allow for an entire slew of interesting results concerning probability densities related to continued fraction element distribution, etc. (though he also notes that no analogue to the geometric mean result can be formulated for the arithmetic mean).

Its topology is equivalent to a pair of cross-caps with coinciding boundaries. It can be represented by connecting the side of a square in the orientations illustrated in the right figure above (Gardner 1984, pp. 15-17; Gray 1997, pp. 323-324).\u000aIt can be cut in half along its length to make two Möbius strips, but can also be cut into a single Möbius strip.

aVThe Kneser graphs are a class of graph introduced by Lovász to prove Kneser's conjecture. Given two positive integers n and k, the Kneser graph K(n, k), often denoted K_(n:k) (Godsil and Royle 2001, pp. 31-32), is the graph whose vertices represent the k-subsets of {1, ..., n}, and where two vertices are connected if and only if they correspond to disjoint subsets. K(n, k) therefore has (n\u000ak) vertices and is regular of degree (n - k\u000ak).

aVThe m×n knight graph is a graph on mn vertices in which each vertex represents a square in an m×n chessboard, and each edge corresponds to a legal move by a knight (which may only make moves which simultaneously shift one square along one axis and two along the other).\u000aThe number of edges in the n×n knight graph is 4(n - 2)(n - 1) (8 times the triangular numbers), so for n = 1, 2, ..., the first few values are 0, 0, 8, 24, 48, 80, 120, ... (OEIS A033996).\u000aKnight graphs are bipartite and therefore are perfect.

aVA fractal, also known as the Koch island, which was first described by Helge von Koch in 1904. It is built by starting with an equilateral triangle, removing the inner third of each side, building another equilateral triangle at the location where the side was removed, and then repeating the process indefinitely. The Koch snowflake can be simply encoded as a Lindenmayer system with initial string F--F--F, string rewriting rule F" -> "F+F--F+F, and angle 60°. The zeroth through third iterations of the construction are shown above.\u000aThe fractal can also be constructed using a base curve and motif, illustrated above.

The point was so named by Rigby, and is the isogonal conjugate of the nine-point center.\u000aThe Kosnita point has triangle center function\u000a\u03b1 = sec(B - C)\u000aand is Kimberling center X_54 (Kimberling 1998, p. 75; note spelling correction).

aVAn algorithm for finding a graph's spanning tree of minimum length. It sorts the edges of a graph in order of increasing cost and then repeatedly adds edges that bridge separate components until the graph is fully connected. By negating the weights for each edge, the algorithm can also be used to find a maximum spanning tree.\u000aKruskal's algorithm is implemented in the Wolfram Language as FindSpanningTree[g, Method -> "Kruskal"].

aVA k-subset is a subset of a set on n elements containing exactly k elements. The number of k-subsets on n elements is therefore given by the binomial coefficient (n\u000ak). For example, there are (3\u000a2) = 3 2-subsets of {1, 2, 3}, namely {1, 2}, {1, 3}, and {2, 3}.\u000aThe k-subsets of a list can be enumerated in the Wolfram Language as Subsets[list, {k}].

aVAn attractive tiling of the square composed of two types of triangular tiles. It consists of 16 equilateral triangles and 32 15°-15°-150° isosceles triangles arranged in the shape of a dodecagon.\u000aThe composition of Kürschák's tile is motivated by drawing inward-pointing equilateral triangles on each side of a unit square and then connecting adjacent vertices to form a smaller square rotated 45° with respect to the original square. Joining the midpoints of the square together with the intersections of the equilateral triangles then gives a dodecagon with circumradius\u000aR = sin(\u03c0/12) = 1/4(sqrt(6) - sqrt(2)).

Cayley provided the first proof of the number of labeled trees, and a constructive proof was subsequently provided by Prüfer. Prüfer's result gives an encoding for labeled trees known as Prüfer code (indicated underneath the trees above, where the trees are depicted using an embedding with root at the node labeled 1).\u000aThe probability that a random labeled tree is centered is asymptotically equal to 1/2.

aVA formal logic developed by Alonzo Church and Stephen Kleene to address the computable number problem. In the lambda calculus, \u03bb is defined as the abstraction operator. Three theorems of lambda calculus are \u03b2-conversion, \u03b1-conversion, and \u03b7-conversion. Lambda-reduction (also called lambda conversion) refers to all three.

aVA wide variety of large numbers crop up in mathematics. Some are contrived, but some actually arise in proofs. Often, it is possible to prove existence theorems by deriving some potentially huge upper limit which is frequently greatly reduced in subsequent versions (e.g., Graham's number, Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theorem, Mertens conjecture, Skewes number, Wang's conjecture).
p985
aVThe latitude of a point on a sphere is the elevation of the point from the plane of the equator. The latitude \u03b4 is related to the colatitude (the polar angle in spherical coordinates) by \u03b4 = 90° - \u03d5. More generally, the latitude of a point on an ellipsoid is the angle between a line perpendicular to the surface of the ellipsoid at the given point and the plane of the equator.\u000aThe equator therefore has latitude 0°, and the north and south poles have latitude ± 90°, respectively. Latitude is also called geographic latitude or geodetic latitude in order to distinguish it from several subtly different varieties of authalic latitudes.

aVAn algebra \u2329L;\u22c0, \u22c1\u232a is called a lattice if L is a nonempty set, \u22c0 and \u22c1 are binary operations on L, both \u22c0 and \u22c1 are idempotent, commutative, and associative, and they satisfy the absorption law. The study of lattices is called lattice theory.\u000aNote that this type of lattice is distinct from the regular array of points known as a point lattice (or informally as a mesh or grid). While every point lattice is a lattice under the ordering inherited from the plane, many lattices are not point lattices.\u000aLattices offer a natural way to formalize and study the ordering of objects using a general concept known as the partially ordered set.
p987
aVThe lattice method is an alternative to long multiplication for numbers. In this approach, a lattice is first constructed, sized to fit the numbers being multiplied. If we are multiplying an m-digit number by an n-digit number, the size of the lattice is m×n. The multiplicand is placed along the top of the lattice so that each digit is the header for one column of cells (the most significant digit is put at the left). The multiplier is placed along the right side of the lattice so that each digit is a (trailing) header for one row of cells (the most significant digit is put at the top). Illustrated above is the lattice configuration for computing 948×827.

A lattice path is therefore a sequence of points P_0, P_1, ..., P_n with n>=0 such that each P_i is a lattice point and P_(i + 1) is obtained by offsetting one unit east (or west) or one unit north (or south).\u000aThe number of paths of length a + b from the origin (0, 0) to a point (a, b) which are restricted to east and north steps is given by the binomial coefficient (a + b\u000aa).

p994
aVA mathematical procedure for finding the best-fitting curve to a given set of points by minimizing the sum of the squares of the offsets ("the residuals") of the points from the curve. The sum of the squares of the offsets is used instead of the offset absolute values because this allows the residuals to be treated as a continuous differentiable quantity. However, because squares of the offsets are used, outlying points can have a disproportionate effect on the fit, a property which may or may not be desirable depending on the problem at hand.

aVThe Lebesgue integral is defined in terms of upper and lower bounds using the Lebesgue measure of a set. It uses a Lebesgue sum S_n = sum_i \u03b7_i \u03bc(E_i) where \u03b7_i is the value of the function in subinterval i, and \u03bc(E_i) is the Lebesgue measure of the set E_i of points for which values are approximately \u03b7_i. This type of integral covers a wider class of functions than does the Riemann integral.

aVThe lemniscate, also called the lemniscate of Bernoulli, is a polar curve whose most common form is the locus of points the product of whose distances from two fixed points (called the foci) a distance 2a away is the constant a^2. This gives the Cartesian equation\u000a[(x - c)^2 + y^2][(x + c)^2 + y^2] = c^4, where both sides of the equation have been squared.

Lévy showed that \u03b2 element (0, 2) for P(x) to be nonnegative. The Lévy distribution has infinite variance and sometimes infinite mean.

aVA one-person game played on a rectangular lattice of lamps which can be turned on and off. A move consists of flipping a "switch" inside one of the squares, thereby toggling the on/off state of this and all four vertically and horizontally adjacent squares. Starting from a randomly chosen light pattern, the aim is to turn all the lamps off. The problem of determining if it is possible to start from set of all lights being on to all lights being off is known as the "all-ones problem." As shown by Sutner, this is always possible for a square lattice (Rangel-Mondragon).\u000aThis can be translated into the following algebraic problem.

aVThe limaçon is a polar curve of the form\u000ar = b + acos\u03b8\u000aalso called the limaçon of Pascal. It was first investigated by Dürer, who gave a method for drawing it in Underweysung der Messung. It was rediscovered by Étienne Pascal, father of Blaise Pascal, and named by Gilles-Personne Roberval in 1650 (MacTutor Archive). The word "limaçon" comes from the Latin limax, meaning "snail."\u000aIf b>=2a, the limaçon is convex. If 2a>b>a, the limaçon is dimpled. If b = a, the limaçon degenerates to a cardioid.

aVLinear programming, sometimes known as linear optimization, is the problem of maximizing or minimizing a linear function over a convex polyhedron specified by linear and non-negativity constraints. Simplistically, linear programming is the optimization of an outcome based on some set of constraints using a linear mathematical model.\u000aLinear programming is implemented in the Wolfram Language as LinearProgramming[c, m, b], which finds a vector x which minimizes the quantity cx subject to the constraints mx>=b and x_i >=0 for x = (x_1, ..., x_n).

aVA linear transformation between two vector spaces V and W is a map T:V->W such that the following hold: \u000a1.T(v_1 + v_2) = T(v_1) + T(v_2) for any vectors v_1 and v_2 in V, and \u000a2.T(\u03b1v) = \u03b1T(v) for any scalar \u03b1. \u000aA linear transformation may or may not be injective or surjective. When V and W have the same dimension, it is possible for T to be invertible, meaning there exists a T^(-1) such that TT^(-1) = I. It is always the case that T(0) = 0. Also, a linear transformation always maps lines to lines (or to zero).

aVA closed interval corresponding to a finite portion of an infinite line. Line segments are generally labeled with two letters corresponding to their endpoints, say A and B, and then written AB. The length of the line segment is indicated with an overbar, so the length of the line segment AB would be written (AB)^_.\u000aCuriously, the number of points in a line segment is equal to that in an entire one-dimensional space (a line), and also to the number of points in an n-dimensional space, as first recognized by Georg Cantor.

aVThere are several different definition of link.\u000aIn knot theory, a link is one or more disjointly embedded circles in three-space. More informally, a link is an assembly of knots with mutual entanglements. Kuperberg has shown that a nontrivial knot or link in R^3 has four collinear points (Eppstein). Like knots, links can be decomposed into basic units known as prime links.\u000aThe term "link" is also used primarily by physicists to refer to a graph edge.

Liouville's constant is a decimal fraction with a 1 in each decimal place corresponding to a factorial n!, and zeros everywhere else. Liouville constructed an infinite class of transcendental numbers using continued fractions, but the above number was the first decimal constant to be proven transcendental. However, Cantor subsequently proved that "almost all" real numbers are in fact transcendental.

aVA list is a data structure consisting of an ordered set of elements, each of which may be a number, another list, etc. A list is usually denoted (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) or {a_1, a_2, ..., a_n}, and may also be interpreted as a vector (specifically, an n-vector) or an n-tuple. Multiplicity matters in a list, so (1, 1, 2) and (1, 2) are not equivalent.

aVA graph G is said to be locally X, where X is a graph (or class of graphs), when for every vertex v, the graph induced on G by the set of adjacent vertices of V (sometimes called the ego graph in more recent literature) is isomorphic to (or to a member of) X. Note that the term "neighbors" is sometimes used instead of "adjacent vertices" here (e.g., Brouwer et al. 1989), so care is needed since the definition of local graphs excludes the vertex v on which a subgraph is induced, while the definitions of graph neighborhood and neighborhood graph include v itself.

The difficulty of formal logic was demonstrated in the monumental Principia Mathematica of Whitehead and Russell's, in which hundreds of pages of symbols were required before the statement 1 + 1 = 2 could be deduced.

aVA continuous distribution in which the logarithm of a variable has a normal distribution. It is a general case of Gibrat's distribution, to which the log normal distribution reduces with S = 1 and M = 0. A log normal distribution results if the variable is the product of a large number of independent, identically-distributed variables in the same way that a normal distribution results if the variable is the sum of a large number of independent, identically-distributed variables.

The example above shows how the division of 123456/17 is performed to obtain the result 7262.11....\u000aThe term "long division" is also used to refer to the method of dividing one polynomial by another, as illustrated above. This example illustrates the result\u000a(x^4 + x + 1)/(x + 1) = (x^3 - x^2 + x) + 1/(x + 1).\u000aThe symbol separating the dividend from the divisor seems to have no established name, so can be simply referred to as the long division symbol (or sometimes the division bracket).

aVThe azimuthal coordinate on the surface of a sphere (\u03b8 in spherical coordinates) or on a spheroid (in prolate or oblate spheroidal coordinates). Longitude is defined such that 0° = 360°. Lines of constant longitude are generally called meridians. The other angular coordinate on the surface of a sphere is called the latitude.\u000aThe shortest distance between any two points on a sphere is the so-called great circle distance, which can be directly computed from the latitude and longitudes of two points.

aVLong multiplication is the method of multiplication that is commonly taught to elementary school students throughout the world. It can be used on two numbers of arbitrarily large size or number of decimal digits. The numbers to be multiplied are placed vertically over one another with their least significant digits aligned.

Similarly, starting the sequence instead with the digit d for 2<=d<=9 gives d, 1d, 111d, 311d, 13211d, 111312211d, 31131122211d, 1321132132211d, ..., as summarized in the following table.

Now join the new vertices S_(AB) and S_(AC) of this square with the vertex A, marking the points of intersection Q_(A, BC) and Q_(A, CB). Next, draw lines perpendicular to the side BC through each of Q_(A, BC) and Q_(A, CB). These points cross the sides AB and AC at Q_(AB) and Q_(AC), respectively, resulting in an inscribed square Q_(A, BC) Q_(A, CB) Q_(AB) Q_(AC). The circumcircle through A, Q_(AB), and Q_(AC) is then known as the Lucas A-circles, and repeating the process for other sides gives the corresponding B- and C-circles.

aVMastermind is a simple two-player code-breaking board game invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert. It may have been inspired by moo, a program developed by J. M. Grochow at MIT in the late 1960s.

aVA matching, also called an independent edge set, on a graph G is a set of edges of G such that no two sets share a vertex in common.\u000aIt is not possible for a matching on a graph with n nodes to exceed n/2 edges. When a matching with n/2 edges exists, it is called a perfect matching. When a matching exists that leaves a single vertex unmatched, it is called a near-perfect matching.

aVThe five Mathieu groups M_11, M_12, M_22, M_23, and M_24 were the first sporadic groups discovered, having been found in 1861 and 1873 by Mathieu. Frobenius showed that all the Mathieu groups are subgroups of M_24.\u000aThe sporadic Mathieu groups are implemented in the Wolfram Language as MathieuGroupM11[], MathieuGroupM12[], MathieuGroupM22[], MathieuGroupM23[], and MathieuGroupM24[].

aVA matrix is a concise and useful way of uniquely representing and working with linear transformations. In particular, every linear transformation can be represented by a matrix, and every matrix corresponds to a unique linear transformation. The matrix, and its close relative the determinant, are extremely important concepts in linear algebra, and were first formulated by Sylvester and Cayley.

aVGiven an m×n matrix A and a p×q matrix B, their Kronecker product C = A\u2297B, also called their matrix direct product, is an (mp)×(nq) matrix with elements defined by\u000ac_\u03b1\u03b2 = a_(ij) b_(kl), where\u000a\u03b1 | congruent | p(i - 1) + k\u000a\u03b2 | congruent | q(j - 1) + l.

aVThe inverse of a square matrix A, sometimes called a reciprocal matrix, is a matrix A^(-1) such that\u000aAA^(-1) = I, where I is the identity matrix. Courant and Hilbert use the notation A^\u02c7 to denote the inverse matrix.\u000aA square matrix A has an inverse iff the determinant left bracketing bar A right bracketing bar !=0. The so-called invertible matrix theorem is major result in linear algebra which associates the existence of a matrix inverse with a number of other equivalent properties. A matrix possessing an inverse is called nonsingular, or invertible.
p1089
aVThe product C of two matrices A and B is defined as\u000ac_(ik) = a_(ij) b_(jk), where j is summed over for all possible values of i and k and the notation above uses the Einstein summation convention. The implied summation over repeated indices without the presence of an explicit sum sign is called Einstein summation, and is commonly used in both matrix and tensor analysis.

aVGiven a square complex or real matrix A, a matrix norm left double bracketing bar A right double bracketing bar is a nonnegative number associated with A having the properties \u000a1. left double bracketing bar A right double bracketing bar >0 when A!=0 and left double bracketing bar A right double bracketing bar = 0 iff A = 0, 2. left double bracketing bar kA right double bracketing bar = left bracketing bar k right bracketing bar left double bracketing bar A right double bracketing bar for any scalar k, 3. left double bracketing bar A + B right double bracketing bar <= left double bracketing bar A right double bracketing bar + left double bracketing bar B right double bracketing bar , 4. left double bracketing bar AB right double bracketing bar <= left double bracketing bar A right double bracketing bar left double bracketing bar B right double bracketing bar . \u000aLet \u03bb_1, ..., \u03bb_n be the eigenvalues of A, then\u000a1/( left double bracketing bar A^(-1) right double bracketing bar )<= left bracketing bar \u03bb right bracketing bar <= left double bracketing bar A right double bracketing bar .

aVThe power A^n of a matrix A for n a nonnegative integer is defined as the matrix product of n copies of A, A^n = A...A_\ufe38_n .\u000aA matrix to the zeroth power is defined to be the identity matrix of the same dimensions, A^0 = I. The matrix inverse is commonly denoted A^(-1), which should not be interpreted to mean 1/A.
p1092
aVThe rank of a matrix or a linear transformation is the dimension of the image of the matrix or the linear transformation, corresponding to the number of linearly independent rows or columns of the matrix, or to the number of nonzero singular values of the map.\u000aThe rank of a matrix m is implemented as MatrixRank[m].
p1093
aVThe trace of an n×n square matrix A is defined to be\u000aTr(A) congruent sum_(i = 1)^n a_(ii), i.e., the sum of the diagonal elements. The matrix trace is implemented in the Wolfram Language as Tr[list]. In group theory, traces are known as "group characters."

aVA Maurer rose is a plot of a "walk" along an n- (or 2n-) leafed rose in steps of a fixed number d degrees, including all cosets.
p1095
aVThe largest value of a set, function, etc. The maximum value of a set of elements A = {a_i}_(i = 1)^N is denoted maxA or max_i a_i, and is equal to the last element of a sorted (i.e., ordered) version of A. For example, given the set {3, 5, 4, 1}, the sorted version is {1, 3, 4, 5}, so the maximum is 5. The maximum and minimum are the simplest order statistics.\u000aThe maximum value of a variable x is commonly denoted x_max (Strang 1988, pp. 286-287 and 301-303) or x_max (Golub and Van Loan 1996, p. 74). In this work, the convention x_max is used.

aVA deconvolution algorithm (sometimes abbreviated MEM) which functions by minimizing a smoothness function ("entropy") in an image. Maximum entropy is also called the all-poles model or autoregressive model. For images with more than a million pixels, maximum entropy is faster than the CLEAN algorithm.
p1097
aVMaximum likelihood, also called the maximum likelihood method, is the procedure of finding the value of one or more parameters for a given statistic which makes the known likelihood distribution a maximum. The maximum likelihood estimate for a parameter \u03bc is denoted \u03bc^^.\u000aFor a Bernoulli distribution, d/(d\u03b8)[(N\u000aNp) \u03b8^(Np) (1 - \u03b8)^(Nq)] = Np(1 - \u03b8) - \u03b8Nq = 0, so maximum likelihood occurs for \u03b8 = p.

aVThe Maxwell (or Maxwell-Boltzmann) distribution gives the distribution of speeds of molecules in thermal equilibrium as given by statistical mechanics. Defining a = sqrt(kT/m), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, m is the mass of a molecule, and letting x denote the speed a molecule, the probability and cumulative distributions over the range x element [0, \u221e) are

aVA maze, also known as a labyrinth, as is a set of passages (with impermeable walls). The goal of the maze is to start at one given point and find a path through the passages that reaches a second given point.\u000aThe back of a clay accounting tablet from Pylos, Greece is illustrated above. Legend has it that it was the plan for the labyrinth housing the minotaur in the palace at Knossos, Crete, and that it was designed by Daedalus. It is also said that it was a logo for the city of Troy-or perhaps the plan of some of its walls.

aVA McNugget number is a positive integer that can be obtained by adding together orders of McDonald's® Chicken McNuggets\u2122 (prior to consuming any), which originally came in boxes of 6, 9, and 20 (Vardi 1991, pp. 19-20 and 233-234, p. 186). All integers are McNugget numbers except 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 22, 23, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, and 43. The value 43 therefore corresponds to the Frobenius number of {6, 9, 20}.

aVThere are several statistical quantities called means, e.g., harmonic mean, geometric mean, arithmetic-geometric mean, and root-mean-square. When applied to two elements a and b with 0<a<=b, these means satisfy\u000aH(a, b)<=G(a, b)<=AGM(a, b)<=A(a, b)<=RMS(a, b).\u000aThe following table summarizes these means (again applied to two elements a and b with 0<a<=b), where K(k) is a complete elliptic integral of the first kind.

aVThe triangle \u0394M_A M_B M_C formed by joining the midpoints of the sides of a triangle \u0394ABC. The medial triangle is sometimes also called the auxiliary triangle.\u000aThe medial triangle is the Cevian triangle of the triangle centroid G and the pedal triangle of the circumcenter O. It is also the cyclocevian triangle of the orthocenter H.\u000aThe medial triangle is the polar triangle of the Steiner inellipse.

aVThe word "median" has several different meanings in mathematics all related to the "middle" of mathematical objects.\u000aThe statistical median is an order statistic that gives the "middle" value x^~ of a sample. More specifically, it is the value x^~ such that an equal number of samples are less than and greater than the value (for an odd sample size), or the average of the two central values (for an even sample size). The Wolfram Language function Median[list] can be used to find the statistical median of the elements in a list.

aVThe Mercator projection is a map projection that was widely used for navigation since loxodromes are straight lines (although great circles are curved). The following equations place the x-axis of the projection on the equator and the y-axis at longitude \u03bb_0, where \u03bb is the longitude and \u03d5 is the latitude.

aVA Mersenne number is a number of the form\u000aM_n congruent 2^n - 1, where n is an integer. The Mersenne numbers consist of all 1s in base-2, and are therefore binary repunits. The first few Mersenne numbers are 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, ... (OEIS A000225), corresponding to 1_2, 11_2, 111_2, 1111_2, ... in binary.\u000aThe Mersenne numbers are also the numbers obtained by setting x = 1 in a Fermat polynomial. They also correspond to Cunningham numbers C^-(2, n).
p1110
aVA Mersenne prime is a Mersenne number, i.e., a number of the form\u000aM_n congruent 2^n - 1, that is prime. In order for M_n to be prime, n must itself be prime. This is true since for composite n with factors r and s, n = rs. Therefore, 2^n - 1 can be written as 2^(rs) - 1, which is a binomial number that always has a factor (2^r - 1).\u000aThe first few Mersenne primes are 3, 7, 31, 127, 8191, 131071, 524287, 2147483647, ... (OEIS A000668) corresponding to indices n = 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 89, ... (OEIS A000043).

aVThe Mertens function is the summary function\u000aM(n) congruent sum_(k = 1)^n \u03bc(k), where \u03bc(n) is the Möbius function. The first few values are 1, 0, -1, -1, -2, -1, -2, -2, -2, -1, -2, -2, ... (OEIS A002321). M(n) is also given by the determinant of the n×n Redheffer matrix.\u000aValues of M(10^n) for n = 0, 1, 2, ... are given by 1, -1, 1, 2, -23, -48, 212, 1037, 1928, -222, ... (OEIS A084237).

aVA nonnegative function g(x, y) describing the "distance" between neighboring points for a given set. A metric satisfies the triangle inequality\u000ag(x, y) + g(y, z)>=g(x, z)\u000aand is symmetric, so\u000ag(x, y) = g(y, x).\u000aA metric also satisfies\u000ag(x, x) = 0, as well as the condition that g(x, y) = 0 implies x = y. If this latter condition is dropped, then g(x, y) is called a pseudometric instead of a metric.

aVIn the mice problem, also called the beetle problem, n mice start at the corners of a regular n-gon of unit side length, each heading towards its closest neighboring mouse in a counterclockwise direction at constant speed. The mice each trace out a logarithmic spiral, meet in the center of the polygon, and travel a distance\u000ad_n = 1/(1 - cos((2\u03c0)/n)).
p1116
aVThe point on a line segment dividing it into two segments of equal length. The midpoint of a line segment is easy to locate by first constructing a lens using circular arcs, then connecting the cusps of the lens. The point where the cusp-connecting line intersects the segment is then the midpoint (Pedoe 1995, p. xii). It is more challenging to locate the midpoint using only a compass (i.e., a Mascheroni construction).\u000aFor the line segment AB in the plane determined by A = (x_1, y_1) and B = (x_2, y_2), the midpoint can be calculated as\u000aM = (1/2(x_1 + x_2), 1/2(y_1 + y_2)).

aVA derived polygon with side ratios chosen as r = 1/2 so that inscribed polygons are constructed by connecting the midpoints of the base polygon. For a triangle P, the midpoint-inscribed polygons P_1, P_2, ... are similar triangles. For a quadrilateral P, the midpoint-inscribed polygon P_1 is a parallelogram known as the Varignon parallelogram, and P_1, P_3, P_5, ... are similar parallelograms, as are P_2, P_4, P_6, ....

aVIf the period of a repeating decimal for a/p, where p is prime and a/p is a reduced fraction, has an even number of digits, then dividing the repeating portion into halves and adding gives a string of 9s. For example, 1/7 = 0.142857^_, and 142 + 857 = 999.

aVThe minimal enclosing circle problem, sometimes also known as the bomb problem, is the problem of finding the circle of smallest radius that contains a given set of points in its interior or on its boundary. This smallest circle is known as the minimal enclosing circle.\u000aJung's theorem states that every finite set of points with geometric span d has an enclosing circle with radius no greater than d/sqrt(3).

aVMinimal surfaces are defined as surfaces with zero mean curvature. A minimal surface parametrized as x = (u, v, h(u, v)) therefore satisfies Lagrange's equation, (1 + h_v^2) h_(uu) - 2h_u h_v h_(uv) + (1 + h_u^2) h_(vv) = 0\u000a(Gray 1997, p. 399).
p1121
aVThe smallest value of a set, function, etc. The minimum value of a set of elements A = {a_i}_(i = 1)^N is denoted minA or min_i a_i, and is equal to the first element of a sorted (i.e., ordered) version of A. For example, given the set {3, 5, 4, 1}, the sorted version is {1, 3, 4, 5}, so the minimum is 1. The maximum and minimum are the simplest order statistics.\u000aThe minimum value of a variable x is commonly denoted x_min (cf. Strang 1988, pp. 286-287 and 301-303) or x_min (Golub and Van Loan 1996, p. 84). In this work, the convention x_min is used.

aVThe minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph is a set of n - 1 edges of minimum total weight which form a spanning tree of the graph. When a graph is unweighted, any spanning tree is a minimum spanning tree.\u000aThe minimum spanning tree can be found in polynomial time. Common algorithms include those due to Prim and Kruskal's algorithm. The problem can also be formulated using matroids. A minimum spanning tree can be found in the Wolfram Language using the command FindSpanningTree[g].\u000aThe Season 1 episodes "Vector" and "Man Hunt" and Season 2 episode "Rampage" of the television crime drama NUMB3RS feature minimal spanning trees.

aVMinkowski space is a four-dimensional space possessing a Minkowski metric, i.e., a metric tensor having the form\u000ad\u03c4^2 = - (dx^0)^2 + (dx^1)^2 + (dx^2)^2 + (dx^3)^2 .\u000aAlternatively (though less desirably), Minkowski space can be considered to have a Euclidean metric with imaginary time coordinate x^0 = ict where c is the speed of light (by convention c = 1 is normally used) and where i is the imaginary number i = sqrt(-1). Minkowski space unifies Euclidean three-space plus time (the "fourth dimension") in Einstein's theory of special relativity.

aVFor a triangle \u0394ABC and three points A', B', and C', one on each of its sides, the three Miquel circles are the circles passing through each polygon vertex and its neighboring side points (i.e., AC' B', BA' C', and CB' A'). According to Miquel's theorem, the Miquel circles are concurrent in a point M known as the Miquel point. Similarly, there are n Miquel circles for n lines taken (n - 1) at a time.
p1126
aVIf a points A', B', and C' are marked on each side of a triangle \u0394ABC, one on each side (or on a side's extension), then the three Miquel circles (each through a polygon vertex and the two marked points on the adjacent sides) are concurrent at a point M called the Miquel point. This result is a slight generalization of the so-called pivot theorem.\u000aIf M lies in the interior of the triangle, then it satisfies\u000a\u2220P_2 MP_3 | = | 180° - \u03b1_1\u000a\u2220P_3 MP_1 | = | 180° - \u03b1_2\u000a\u2220P_1 MP_2 | = | 180° - \u03b1_3 .

aVA mixed fraction is an improper fraction p/q>1 written in the form n + r/s. In common usage such as cooking recipes, n + r/s is often written as n r/s (e.g., 1 1/2), much to the chagrin of mathematicians, to whom n r/s means nr/s, which is quite a different beast from n + r/s.
p1130
aVA partial derivative of second or greater order with respect to two or more different variables, for example\u000af_(xy) = (d^2 f)/(dxdy).\u000aIf the mixed partial derivatives exist and are continuous at a point x_0, then they are equal at x_0 regardless of the order in which they are taken.

aVA circle that in internally tangent to two sides of a triangle and to the circumcircle is called a mixtilinear incircle. There are three mixtilinear incircles, one corresponding to each angle of the triangle.\u000aThe radius of the A-mixtilinear incircle inscribed in \u2220A is given by\u000a\u03c1_A = rsec^2(1/2 A), where r is the inradius of the reference triangle, and the center function is\u000a\u03b1:\u03b2:\u03b3 = 1/2(1 + cosA - cosB - cosC):1:1.

aVA class of automata similar to cellular automata but which have a single "active" cell instead of updating all cells in parallel. In a mobile automaton, the evolution rules apply only to the active cell, and also specify how the active cell moves from one generation to the next. All cells that are not active remain the same from one generation to the next. Mobile automata can therefore be considered a hybrid between elementary cellular automata and Turing machines. An example is shown above.\u000aTwo-dimensional mobile automata are also possible, but the number of possible rules is much larger than can be systematically categorized.

aVIn many computer languages (such as FORTRAN or the Wolfram Language), the common residue of b (mod m) is written mod(b, m) (FORTRAN) or Mod[b, m] (Wolfram Language).\u000aThe function mod(m, n) is related to the floor function \u230ax\u230b by\u000amod(m, n) | = | m - n\u230am/n\u230b\u000a | = | m - n(m\u005cn), where m\u005cn denotes the quotient, i.e., integer division.

aVThe most common value obtained in a set of observations. For example, for a data set (3, 7, 3, 9, 9, 3, 5, 1, 8, 5) (left histogram), the unique mode is 3. Similarly, for a data set (2, 4, 9, 6, 4, 6, 6, 2, 8, 2) (right histogram), there are two modes: 2 and 6. A distribution with a single mode is said to be unimodal. A distribution with more than one mode is said to be bimodal, trimodal, etc., or in general, multimodal. The mode of a set of data is implemented in the Wolfram Language as Commonest[data].

aVModular arithmetic is the arithmetic of congruences, sometimes known informally as "clock arithmetic." In modular arithmetic, numbers "wrap around" upon reaching a given fixed quantity, which is known as the modulus (which would be 12 in the case of hours on a clock, or 60 in the case of minutes or seconds on a clock).

aVThe group \u0393 of all Möbius transformations of the form\u000a\u03c4' = (a\u03c4 + b)/(c\u03c4 + d), where a, b, c, and d are integers with ad - bc = 1. The group can be represented by the 2×2 matrix\u000aA = [a | b\u000ac | d], where det(A) = 1.

aVA modular inverse of an integer b (modulo m) is the integer b^(-1) such that\u000abb^(-1) congruent 1 (mod m).\u000aA modular inverse can be computed in the Wolfram Language using PowerMod[b, -1, m].\u000aEvery nonzero integer b has an inverse (modulo p) for p a prime and b not a multiple of p. For example, the modular inverses of 1, 2, 3, and 4 (mod 5) are 1, 3, 2, and 4.

aVThe important property of Fourier transforms that \u2131_x[cos(2\u03c0k_0 x) f(x)](k) can be expressed in terms of \u2131[f(x)] = F(k) as follows, \u2131_x[cos(2\u03c0k_0 x) f(x)](k) = 1/2[F(k - k_0) + F(k + k_0)].
p1140
aVThe word modulus has several different meanings in mathematics with respect to complex numbers, congruences, elliptic integrals, quadratic invariants, sets, etc.\u000aThe modulus of a congruence a congruent b (mod m) is the number m. It is the "base" with respect to which a congruence is computed (i.e., m gives the number of multiples of a that are "thrown out"). For example, when computing the time of day using a 12-hour clock obtained by adding four hours to 9:00, the answer, 1:00, is obtained by taking 9 + 4 congruent 1 (mod 12) (i.e., adding the hours with modulus 12).

The first few values of \u03bc(n) are therefore 1, -1, -1, 0, -1, 1, -1, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0, ... (OEIS A008683). Similarly, the first few values of left bracketing bar \u03bc(n) right bracketing bar for n = 1, 2, ... are 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, ... (OEIS A008966).

aVThe perspective image of an infinite checkerboard. It can be constructed starting from any triangle \u0394OXY, where OX and OY form the near corner of the floor, and XY is the horizon. If OY_1 P_(1, 1) X_1 is the corner tile, the lines Y_1 P_(1, 1) and P_(1, 1) X_1 must be parallel to OX and OY respectively. This means that in the drawing they will meet OX and OY at the horizon, i.e., at point X and point Y respectively. This property, of course, extends to the two bunches of perpendicular lines forming the grid.

aVThe Möbius strip, also called the twisted cylinder, is a one-sided nonorientable surface obtained by cutting a closed band into a single strip, giving one of the two ends thus produced a half twist, and then reattaching the two ends (right figure; Gray 1997, pp. 322-323). The strip bearing his name was invented by Möbius in 1858, although it was independently discovered by Listing, who published it, while Möbius did not. Like the cylinder, it is not a true surface, but rather a surface with boundary.\u000aThe Möbius strip has Euler characteristic \u03c7 = 0.

aVAn interference pattern produced by overlaying similar but slightly offset templates. A simple example is obtained by taking two identical ruled transparent sheets of plastic, superposing them, and rotating one about its center as the other is held fixed.\u000aMoiré patterns can also be created by plotting series of curves on a computer screen. Here, the interference is provided by the discretization of the finite-sized pixels. For example, the illustrations above show a number of concentric circles plotted with a range of uniform spacings. Note the phantom lines and curves that appear.

aVThe moment of inertia with respect to a given axis of a solid body with density \u03c1(r) is defined by the volume integral\u000aI congruent integral \u03c1(r) r_\u22a5^2 dV, where r_\u22a5 is the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation.

aVIn order to integrate a function over a complicated domain D, Monte Carlo integration picks random points over some simple domain D' which is a superset of D, checks whether each point is within D, and estimates the area of D (volume, n-dimensional content, etc.) as the area of D' multiplied by the fraction of points falling within D. Monte Carlo integration is implemented in the Wolfram Language as NIntegrate[f, ..., Method -> MonteCarlo].
p1150
aVAny method which solves a problem by generating suitable random numbers and observing that fraction of the numbers obeying some property or properties. The method is useful for obtaining numerical solutions to problems which are too complicated to solve analytically. It was named by S. Ulam, who in 1946 became the first mathematician to dignify this approach with a name, in honor of a relative having a propensity to gamble. Nicolas Metropolis also made important contributions to the development of such methods.\u000aThe most common application of the Monte Carlo method is Monte Carlo integration.

aVGiven three closed doors, behind one of which is a car and behind the other two of which are goats, you are asked to pick a door and will win whatever is behind it. But before that door is opened, someone who knows what's behind the doors opens one of the other two doors, revealing a goat, and asks you if you wish to change your selection to the third door (i.e., the door which neither you picked nor he opened). Do you?

aVA square-shaped neighborhood that can be used to define a set of cells surrounding a given cell (x_0, y_0) that may affect the evolution of a two-dimensional cellular automaton on a square grid. The Moore neighborhood of range r is defined by\u000aN_(x_0, y_0)^M = {(x, y): left bracketing bar x - x_0 right bracketing bar <=r, left bracketing bar y - y_0 right bracketing bar <=r}.\u000aMoore neighborhoods for ranges r = 0, 1, 2, and 3 are illustrated above. The number of cells in the Moore neighborhood of range r is the odd squares (2r + 1)^2, the first few of which are 1, 9, 25, 49, 81, ... (OEIS A016754).

aVThe points of intersection of the adjacent angle trisectors of the angles of any triangle \u0394ABC are the polygon vertices of an equilateral triangle \u0394DEF known as the first Morley triangle. Taylor and Marr give two geometric proofs and one trigonometric proof.\u000aA line \u2113 is parallel to a side of the first Morley triangle if and only if\u000a\u2221(\u2113, BC) + \u2221(\u2113, CA) + \u2221(\u2113, AB) = 0 (mod \u03c0), in directed angles modulo \u03c0.

aVThe Motzkin numbers enumerate various combinatorial objects. Donaghey and Shapiro give 14 different manifestations of these numbers. In particular, they give the number of paths from (0, 0) to (n, 0) which never dip below y = 0 and are made up only of the steps (1, 0), (1, 1), and (1, -1), i.e., ->, \u2197, and \u2198.\u000aThe first are 1, 2, 4, 9, 21, 51, ... (OEIS A001006). The numbers of decimal digits in M_10^n for n = 0, 1, ... are 1, 4, 45, 473, 4766, 47705, 477113, ... (OEIS A114473), where the digits approach those of log_10 3 = 0.477121... (OEIS A114490).

aVGiven a sequence {a_i}_(i = 1)^N, an n-moving average is a new sequence {s_i}_(i = 1)^(N - n + 1) defined from the a_i by taking the arithmetic mean of subsequences of n terms, s_i = 1/n sum_(j = i)^(i + n - 1) a_j .\u000aSo the sequences S_n giving n-moving averages are\u000aS_2 | = | 1/2(a_1 + a_2, a_2 + a_3, ..., a_(n - 1) + a_n)\u000aS_3 | = | 1/3(a_1 + a_2 + a_3, a_2 + a_3 + a_4, ..., a_(n - 2) + a_(n - 1) + a_n).\u000aand so on. The plot above shows the 2- (red), 4- (yellow), 6- (green), and 8- (blue) moving averages for a set of 100 data points.

aVConsider the sequence of partial sums defined by\u000as_n = sum_(k = 1)^n (-1)^k k^(1/k) .\u000aAs can be seen in the plot above, the sequence has two limit points at -0.81214... and 0.187859... (which are separated by exactly 1). The upper limit point is sometimes known as the MRB constant after the initials of its original investigator (Burns 1999; Plouffe).
p1159
aVA Mrs. Perkins's quilt is a dissection of a square of side n into a number of smaller squares. The name "Mrs. Perkins's Quilt" comes from a problem in one of Dudeney's books, where he gives a solution for n = 13. Unlike a perfect square dissection, however, the smaller squares need not be all different sizes. In addition, only prime dissections are considered so that patterns which can be dissected into lower-order squares are not permitted.\u000aThe smallest numbers of squares needed to create relatively prime dissections of an n×n quilt for n = 1, 2, ... are 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10, 11, 11, 11, 11, 12, ... (OEIS A005670), the first few of which are illustrated above.

aVAn optical illusion in which the orientation of arrowheads makes one line segment look longer than another. In the above figure, the line segments on the left and right are of equal length in both cases.
p1161
aVThe number of multisets of length k on n symbols is sometimes termed "n multichoose k, " denoted ((n\u000ak)) by analogy with the binomial coefficient (n\u000ak). n multichoose k is given by the simple formula\u000a((n\u000ak)) = (n + k - 1\u000ak) = (n - 1, k)!, where (n - 1, k)! is a multinomial coefficient. For example, 3 multichoose 2 is given by 6, since the possible multisets of length 2 on three elements {a, b, c} are {a, a}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, b}, {b, c}, and {c, c}.
p1162
aVThe term multigraph refers to a graph in which multiple edges between nodes are either permitted or required (Skiena 1990, p. 89, Pemmaraju and Skiena 2003, p. 198; Zwillinger 2003, p. 220). West (2000, p. xiv) recommends avoiding the term altogether on the grounds of this ambiguity.\u000aSome references require that multigraphs possess no graph loops, some explicitly allow them (Hartsfield and Ringel 1994, p. 7; Cormen et al. 2001, p. 89), and yet others do not include any explicit allowance or disallowance. Worse still, Tutte uses the term "multigraph" to mean a graph containing either loops or multiple edges.
p1163
aVLet a set of random variates X_1, X_2, ..., X_n have a probability function\u000aP(X_1 = x_1, ..., X_n = x_n) = (N!)/( product_(i = 1)^n x_i !) product_(i = 1)^n \u03b8_i^(x_i)\u000awhere x_i are nonnegative integers such that\u000a sum_(i = 1)^n x_i = N, and \u03b8_i are constants with \u03b8_i>0 and\u000a sum_(i = 1)^n \u03b8_i = 1.
p1164
aVA multiple of a number x is any quantity y = nx with n an integer. If x and y are integers, then x is called a factor of y.

aVA multiple integral is a set of integrals taken over n>1 variables, e.g., integral... integral_\ufe38_n f(x_1, ..., x_n) dx_1 ...dx_n .\u000aAn nth-order integral corresponds, in general, to an n-dimensional volume (i.e., a content), with n = 2 corresponding to an area. In an indefinite multiple integral, the order in which the integrals are carried out can be varied at will; for definite multiple integrals, care must be taken to correctly transform the limits if the order is changed.
p1166
aVA regression giving conditional expectation values of a given variable in terms of two or more other variables.
p1167
aVIn simple algebra, multiplication is the process of calculating the result when a number a is taken b times. The result of a multiplication is called the product of a and b, and each of the numbers a and b is called a factor of the product ab. Multiplication is denoted a×b, a·b, (a)(b), or simply ab. The symbol × is known as the multiplication sign. Normal multiplication is associative, commutative, and distributive.\u000aMore generally, multiplication can also be defined for other mathematical objects such as groups, matrices, sets, and tensors.
p1168
aVA multiplication table is an array showing the result of applying a binary operator to elements of a given set S. For example, the following table is the multiplication table for ordinary multiplication.
p1169
aVA function f(m) is called multiplicative if (m, m') = 1 (i.e., the statement that m and m' are relatively prime) implies\u000af(mm') = f(m) f(m')\u000a(Wilf 1994, p. 58).\u000aExamples of multiplicative functions are the Möbius function and totient function.
p1170
aVLet n be a positive number having primitive roots. If g is a primitive root of n, then the numbers 1, g, g^2, ..., g^(\u03d5(n) - 1) form a reduced residue system modulo n, where \u03d5(n) is the totient function. In this set, there are \u03d5(\u03d5(n)) primitive roots, and these are the numbers g^c, where c is relatively prime to \u03d5(n).\u000aThe smallest exponent e for which b^e congruent 1 (mod n), where b and n are given numbers, is called the multiplicative order (or sometimes haupt-exponent or modulo order) of b (mod n).\u000aThe multiplicative order is implemented in the Wolfram Language as MultiplicativeOrder[g, n].
p1171
aVA set-like object in which order is ignored, but multiplicity is explicitly significant. Therefore, multisets {1, 2, 3} and {2, 1, 3} are equivalent, but {1, 1, 2, 3} and {1, 2, 3} differ. The number of multisets of length k on n symbols is called n multichoose k, denoted ((n\u000ak)).
p1172
aVA function of more than one variable.
p1173
aVA multiway system is a kind of substitution system in which multiple states are permitted at any stage. This accommodates rule systems in which there is more than one possible way to perform an update.\u000aA simple example is a string substitution system. For instance, take the rules {AB->A, BA->B} and the initial condition ABA. There are two choices for how to proceed. Applying the first rule yields the evolution ABA toAA, while applying the second rule yields the evolution ABA->AB->A. So at the first step, there is a single state ({ABA}), at the second step there are two states {AA, AB}, and at the third step there is a single state {A}.
p1174
aVA plot of the cells on a grid satisfying bitwise XOR(a, b)<n for consecutive values of n = 1, 2, .... It is thought that it was discovered by Jackson Wright on the RLE PDP-1 around 1962 . The plots above show the results in static and animated form for n = 1 to 15 on a grid running from 0 to 15.

aVLet T_1 be the point at which the J_1-excircle meets the side A_2 A_3 of a triangle \u0394A_1 A_2 A_3, and define T_2 and T_3 similarly. Then the lines A_1 T_1, A_2 T_2, and A_3 T_3 concur in the Nagel point Na (sometimes denoted M). The Nagel point has triangle center function\u000a\u03b1 = (b + c - a)/a\u000aand is Kimberling center X_8.\u000aThe triangle \u0394T_1 T_2 T_3 is called the extouch triangle, and its is therefore the Cevian triangle with respect to the Nagel point.
p1176
aVNapier's bones, also called Napier's rods, are numbered rods which can be used to perform multiplication of any number by a number 2-9. By placing "bones" corresponding to the multiplier on the left side and the bones corresponding to the digits of the multiplicand next to it to the right, and product can be read off simply by adding pairs of numbers (with appropriate carries as needed) in the row determined by the multiplier. This process was published by Napier in 1617 an a book titled Rabdologia, so the process is also called rabdology.

aVIf equilateral triangles \u0394ABE_(AB), \u0394BCE_(BC), and \u0394ACE_(AC) are erected externally on the sides of any triangle \u0394ABC, then their centers N_(AB), N_(BC), and N_(AC), respectively, form an equilateral triangle (the outer Napoleon triangle) \u0394N_(AB) N_(BC) N_(AC). An additional property of the externally erected triangles also attributed to Napoleon is that their circumcircles concur in the first Fermat point X. Furthermore, the lines AE_(BC), BE_(AC), and CE_(AB) connecting the vertices of \u0394ABC with the opposite vectors of the erected triangles also concur at X.
p1179
aVA Nash equilibrium of a strategic game is a profile of strategies (s_1^*, ..., s_n^*), where s_i^* element S_i (S_i is the strategy set of player i), such that for each player i, for all s_i element S_i, u_i(s_i^*, s_(-i)^*)>=u_i(s_i, s_(-i)^*), where s_(-i) = (s)_(j element N\u005c{i}) and u_i :S congruent ×_(j element N) S_j ->R.\u000aAnother way to state the Nash equilibrium condition is that s_i^* solves max_(s_i element S_i) u_i(s_i, s_(-i)^*) for each i. In words, in a Nash equilibrium, no player has an incentive to deviate from the strategy chosen, since no player can choose a better strategy given the choices of the other players.

aVThe natural logarithm lnx is the logarithm having base e, where\u000ae = 2.71828....\u000aThis function can be defined\u000alnx congruent integral_1^x (dt)/t\u000afor x>0.\u000aThis definition means that e is the unique number with the property that the area of the region bounded by the hyperbola y = 1/x, the x-axis, and the vertical lines x = 1 and x = e is 1.
p1181
aVThe term "natural number" refers either to a member of the set of positive integers 1, 2, 3, ... (OEIS A000027) or to the set of nonnegative integers 0, 1, 2, 3, ... (OEIS A001477; e.g., Bourbaki 1968, Halmos 1974). Regrettably, there seems to be no general agreement about whether to include 0 in the set of natural numbers. In fact, Ribenboim states "Let P be a set of natural numbers; whenever convenient, it may be assumed that 0 element P."\u000aThe set of natural numbers (whichever definition is adopted) is denoted N.

aVAn N-cluster is a point lattice configuration in which the distance between every pair of points is an integer, no three points are collinear, and no four points are concyclic. An example is the 6-cluster (0, 0), (132, -720), (546, -272), (960, -720), (1155, 540), (546, 1120).\u000aCall the radius of the smallest circle centered at one of the points of an N-cluster which contains all the points in the N-cluster the extent. Noll and Bell found 91 nonequivalent prime 6-clusters of extent less than 20937, but found no 7-clusters.
p1184
aVThe nearest integer function, also called nint or the round function, is defined such that nint(x) is the integer closest to x. While the notation \u230ax\u2309 is sometimes used to denote the nearest integer function , this notation is rather cumbersome and is not recommended. Also note that while [x] is sometimes used to denote the nearest integer function, [x] is also commonly used to denote the floor function \u230ax\u230b (including by Gauss in his third proof of quadratic reciprocity in 1808), so this notational use is also discouraged.
p1185
aVThe problem in computational geometry of identifying the point from a set of points which is nearest to a given point according to some measure of distance. The nearest neighborhood problem involves identifying the locus of points lying nearer to the query point than to any other point in the set.\u000aThe nearest neighbor x from the set of points u_1, u_2 can be computed in the Wolfram Language using Nearest[{u1, u2, ..., }, x].\u000aAn extensive site of nearest neighbor material is maintained by Lifshits.

aVThe necker cube is an illusion in which a two-dimensional drawing of an array of cubes appears to simultaneously protrude from and intrude into the page.\u000aA Necker cube appears on the banner shown in Escher's lithographs "Metamorphosis I" (Bool et al. 1982, p. 271; Forty 2003, p. 39), "Cycle" , and "Convex and Concave". It is also the basis for the arcade game Q*bert.\u000aDepending on the view point chosen for projection, the cubes may be composed of one, two, or three types of rhombi.\u000aThe Necker cube is also a tiling that was used in ancient times, including as a mosaic on the floor of one of the houses in Pompeii, as illustrated in the photograph above (courtesy of S. Jaskulowski).

aVIn the technical combinatorial sense, an a-ary necklace of length n is a string of n characters, each of a possible types. Rotation is ignored, in the sense that b_1 b_2 ...b_n is equivalent to b_k b_(k + 1) ...b_n b_1 b_2 ...b_(k - 1) for any k.\u000aIn fixed necklaces, reversal of strings is respected, so they represent circular collections of beads in which the necklace may not be picked up out of the plane (i.e., opposite orientations are not considered equivalent).

aVThe negabinary representation of a number n is its representation in base -2 (i.e., base negative 2). It is therefore given by the coefficients a_n a_(n - 1) ...a_1 a_0 in\u000an | = | sum_(i = 0) a_i (-2)^i\u000a | = | ... + a_2 (-2)^2 + a_1 (-2)^1 + a_0 (-2)^0, where a_i = 0, 1.

aVThe 2-cusped epicycloid is called a nephroid. The name nephroid means "kidney shaped" and was first used for the two-cusped epicycloid by Proctor in 1878 (MacTutor Archive).\u000aThe nephroid is the catacaustic for rays originating at the cusp of a cardioid and reflected by it. In addition, Huygens showed in 1678 that the nephroid is the catacaustic of a circle when the light source is at infinity, an observation which he published in his Traité de la luminère in 1690 (MacTutor Archive). (Trott 2004, p. 17, mistakenly states that the catacaustic for parallel light falling on any concave mirror is a nephroid.) The shape of the "flat visor curve" produced by a pop-up card dubbed the "knight's visor" is half a nephroid.
p1191
aVExpressions of the form\u000alim_(k->\u221e) x_0 + sqrt(x_1 + sqrt(x_2 + sqrt(... + x_k)))\u000aare called nested radicals. Herschfeld proved that a nested radical of real nonnegative terms converges iff (x_n)^(2^(-n)) is bounded. He also extended this result to arbitrary powers (which include continued square roots and continued fractions as well), a result is known as Herschfeld's convergence theorem.

aVThe word net has several meanings in mathematics. It refers to a plane diagram in which the polyhedron edges of a polyhedron are shown, a point set satisfying certain uniformity of distribution conditions, and a topological generalization of a sequence.\u000aThe net of a polyhedron is also known as a development, pattern, or planar net. The illustrations above show polyhedron nets for the cube and tetrahedron.\u000aIn his classic Treatise on Measurement with the Compass and Ruler, Dürer made one of the first presentations of a net.

aVA geometric construction, also called a verging construction, which allows the classical geometric construction rules to be bent in order to permit sliding of a marked ruler. Using a Neusis construction, cube duplication, angle trisection, and construction of the regular heptagon are soluble. The conchoid of Nicomedes can also be used to perform many Neusis constructions. Conway and Guy give Neusis constructions for the 7-, 9-, and 13-gons which are based on angle trisection.

aVThe Newton-Cotes formulas are an extremely useful and straightforward family of numerical integration techniques.\u000aTo integrate a function f(x) over some interval [a, b], divide it into n equal parts such that f_n = f(x_n) and h congruent (b - a)/n. Then find polynomials which approximate the tabulated function, and integrate them to approximate the area under the curve. To find the fitting polynomials, use Lagrange interpolating polynomials. The resulting formulas are called Newton-Cotes formulas, or quadrature formulas.

aVNewton's method, also called the Newton-Raphson method, is a root-finding algorithm that uses the first few terms of the Taylor series of a function f(x) in the vicinity of a suspected root. Newton's method is sometimes also known as Newton's iteration, although in this work the latter term is reserved to the application of Newton's method for computing square roots.\u000aFor f(x) a polynomial, Newton's method is essentially the same as Horner's method.\u000aThe Taylor series of f(x) about the point x = x_0 + \u03f5 is given by\u000af(x_0 + \u03f5) = f(x_0) + f'(x_0) \u03f5 + 1/2 f''(x_0) \u03f5^2 + ....

aVEvery position of every impartial game has a nim-value, making it equivalent to a nim-heap. To find the nim-value (also called the Sprague-Grundy number), take the mex of the nim-values of the possible moves. The nim-value can also be found by writing the number of counters in each heap in binary, adding corresponding binary digits (mod 2), and interpreting the resulting binary string as a decimal number.

aVThe nine-point circle, also called Euler's circle or the Feuerbach circle, is the circle that passes through the perpendicular feet H_A, H_B, and H_C dropped from the vertices of any reference triangle \u0394ABC on the sides opposite them. Euler showed in 1765 that it also passes through the midpoints M_A, M_B, M_C of the sides of \u0394ABC. By Feuerbach's theorem, the nine-point circle also passes through the midpoints E_A, E_B, and E_C of the segments that join the vertices and the orthocenter H. These points are commonly referred to as the Euler points.\u000aThese three triples of points make nine in all, giving the circle its name.

aVAn error which is superimposed on top of a true signal. Noise may be random or systematic. Noise can be greatly reduced by transmitting signals digitally instead of in analog form because each piece of information is allowed only discrete values which are spaced farther apart than the contribution due to noise.\u000aCoding theory studies how to encode information efficiently, and error-correcting codes devise methods for transmitting and reconstructing information in the presence of noise.

When such structure is present (note that this does not include the expected bunching of points along the z-axis according to the factor sin\u03d5 in the spherical volume element), numbers may not be truly random.

aVIn three dimensions, there are three classes of constant curvature geometries. All are based on the first four of Euclid's postulates, but each uses its own version of the parallel postulate. The "flat" geometry of everyday intuition is called Euclidean geometry (or parabolic geometry), and the non-Euclidean geometries are called hyperbolic geometry (or Lobachevsky-Bolyai-Gauss geometry) and elliptic geometry (or Riemannian geometry). Spherical geometry is a non-Euclidean two-dimensional geometry. It was not until 1868 that Beltrami proved that non-Euclidean geometries were as logically consistent as Euclidean geometry.

aVA surface such as the Möbius strip or Klein bottle on which there exists a closed path such that the directrix is reversed when moved around this path. The real projective plane is also a nonorientable surface, as are the Boy surface, cross-cap, and Roman surface, all of which are homeomorphic to the real projective plane.\u000aThere is a general method for constructing nonorientable surfaces which proceeds as follows. Choose three homogeneous polynomials of positive even degree and consider the map\u000af = (f_1(x, y, z), f_2(x, y, z), f_3(x, y, z)):R^3 ->R^3 .

aVNonparametric estimation is a statistical method that allows the functional form of a fit to data to be obtained in the absence of any guidance or constraints from theory. As a result, the procedures of nonparametric estimation have no meaningful associated parameters. Two types of nonparametric techniques are artificial neural networks and kernel estimation.\u000aArtificial neural networks model an unknown function by expressing it as a weighted sum of several sigmoids, usually chosen to be logit curves, each of which is a function of all the relevant explanatory variables. This amounts to an extremely flexible functional form for which estimation requires a nonlinear least-squares iterative search algorithm based on gradients.

aVA square matrix that is not singular, i.e., one that has a matrix inverse. Nonsingular matrices are sometimes also called regular matrices. A square matrix is nonsingular iff its determinant is nonzero. For example, there are 6 nonsingular 2×2 (0, 1)-matrices:\u000a[0 | 1\u000a1 | 0], [0 | 1\u000a1 | 1], [1 | 0\u000a0 | 1], [1 | 0\u000a1 | 1], [1 | 1\u000a0 | 1], [1 | 1\u000a1 | 0].\u000aThe following table gives the numbers of nonsingular n×n matrices for certain matrix classes.

Let M subset R^3 be a regular surface, p element M, x be an injective regular patch of M with p = x(u_0, v_0), and\u000av_p = ax_u(u_0, v_0) + bx_v(u_0, v_0), where v_p element M_p.

aVA normal distribution in a variate X with mean \u03bc and variance \u03c3^2 is a statistic distribution with probability density function\u000aP(x) = 1/(\u03c3sqrt(2\u03c0)) e^(-(x - \u03bc)^2/(2\u03c3^2))\u000aon the domain x element (-\u221e, \u221e). While statisticians and mathematicians uniformly use the term "normal distribution" for this distribution, physicists sometimes call it a Gaussian distribution and, because of its curved flaring shape, social scientists refer to it as the "bell curve." Feller uses the symbol \u03c6(x) for P(x) in the above equation, but then switches to n(x) in Feller.

aVA number is said to be simply normal to base b if its base-b expansion has each digit appearing with average frequency tending to b^(-1).\u000aA normal number is an irrational number for which any finite pattern of numbers occurs with the expected limiting frequency in the expansion in a given base (or all bases). For example, for a normal decimal number, each digit 0-9 would be expected to occur 1/10 of the time, each pair of digits 00-99 would be expected to occur 1/100 of the time, etc. A number that is normal in base-b is often called b-normal.\u000aA number that is b-normal for every b = 2, 3, ... is said to be absolutely normal.

aVLet M subset R^3 be a regular surface and u_p a unit tangent vector to M, and let \u03a0(u_p, N(p)) be the plane determined by u_p and the normal to the surface N(p). Then the normal section of M is defined as the intersection of \u03a0(u_p, N(p)) and M.

aVThe normal vector, often simply called the "normal, " to a surface is a vector which is perpendicular to the surface at a given point. When normals are considered on closed surfaces, the inward-pointing normal (pointing towards the interior of the surface) and outward-pointing normal are usually distinguished.\u000aThe unit vector obtained by normalizing the normal vector (i.e., dividing a nonzero normal vector by its vector norm) is the unit normal vector, often known simply as the "unit normal." Care should be taken to not confuse the terms "vector norm" (length of vector), "normal vector" (perpendicular vector) and "normalized vector" (unit-length vector).

aVAn n-tuple, sometimes simply called a "tuple" when the number n is known implicitly, is another word for a list, i.e., an ordered set of n elements.

aVBy asking a small number of innocent-sounding questions about an unknown number, it is possible to reconstruct the number with absolute certainty (assuming that the questions are answered correctly).

aVAn obtuse triangle is a triangle in which one of the angles is an obtuse angle. (Obviously, only a single angle in a triangle can be obtuse or it wouldn't be a triangle.) A triangle must be either obtuse, acute, or right.\u000aFrom the law of cosines, for a triangle with side lengths a, b, and c, cosC = (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)/(2ab), with C the angle opposite side C. For an angle to be obtuse, cosC<0. Therefore, an obtuse triangle satisfies one of a^2 + b^2<c^2, b^2 + c^2<a^2, or c^2 + a^2<b^2.

Integers which are not odd are called even.\u000aOdd numbers leave a remainder of 1 when divided by two, i.e., the congruence n congruent 1 (mod 2) holds for odd n. The oddness of a number is called its parity, so an odd number has parity 1, while an even number has parity 0.\u000aThe generating function for the odd numbers is\u000a(x(1 + x))/(x - 1)^2 = x + 3x^2 + 5x^3 + 7x^4 + ....

Two quantities f and \u03d5 which are within about a factor of 10 of each other are then said to be "of the same order of magnitude, " written f~\u03d5.\u000aHardy and Wright use the term to mean asymptotic to.

aVGiven a sample of n variates X_1, ..., X_N, reorder them so that Y_1<Y_2<...<Y_N. Then Y_i is called the ith order statistic, sometimes also denoted X^(\u2329i\u232a). Special cases include the minimum\u000aY_1 congruent min_j(X_j)\u000aand maximum\u000aY_N congruent max_j(X_j).

aVIn common usage, an ordinal number is an adjective which describes the numerical position of an object, e.g., first, second, third, etc.\u000aIn formal set theory, an ordinal number (sometimes simply called an "ordinal" for short) is one of the numbers in Georg Cantor's extension of the whole numbers. An ordinal number is defined as the order type of a well ordered set. Finite ordinal numbers are commonly denoted using arabic numerals, while transfinite ordinals are denoted using lower case Greek letters.

aVOrigami is the Japanese art of paper folding. In traditional origami, constructions are done using a single sheet of colored paper that is often, though not always, square. In modular origami, a number of individual "units, " each folded from a single sheet of paper, are combined to form a compound structure. Origami is an extremely rich art form, and constructions for thousands of objects, from dragons to buildings to vegetables have been devised. Many mathematical shapes can also be constructed, especially using modular origami. The images above show a number of modular polyhedral origami, together with an animated crane constructed in the Wolfram Language by L. Zamiatina.

aVGiven a triangle \u0394ABC, the triangle \u0394H_A H_B H_C whose vertices are endpoints of the altitudes from each of the vertices of \u0394ABC is called the orthic triangle, or sometimes the altitude triangle. The three lines AH_A, BH_B, and CH_C are concurrent at the orthocenter H of \u0394ABC.\u000aThe orthic triangle is therefore both the pedal triangle and Cevian triangle with respect to H. It is also the cyclocevian triangle of the triangle centroid G.

aVThe intersection H of the three altitudes AH_A, BH_B, and CH_C of a triangle is called the orthocenter. The name was invented by Besant and Ferrers in 1865 while walking on a road leading out of Cambridge, England in the direction of London. The trilinear coordinates of the orthocenter are\u000acosBcosC:cosCcosA:cosAcosB.\u000aIf the triangle is not a right triangle, then (-1) can be divided through by cosAcosBcosC to give\u000asecA:secB:secC.\u000aThe orthocenter is Kimberling center X_4.

aVA set of four points, one of which is the orthocenter of the other three. In an orthocentric system, each point is the orthocenter of the triangle of the other three, as illustrated above. The incenter and excenters of a triangle are an orthocentric system.\u000aThe centers of the circumcircles of the points in an orthocentric system form another orthocentric system congruent to the first, and are the reflection of the original points in their common nine-point center.\u000aThe centroids of the points in an orthocentric system form another orthocentric system similar to the first, but one third the size.

aVThe orthocentroidal circle of a triangle \u0394ABC is a central circle having the segment joining the triangle centroid G and orthocenter H of \u0394ABC as its diameter. Since the Euler line passes through G and H, it therefore bisects the orthocentroidal circle.\u000aIt has circle function\u000al = - 2/3 cosA, which corresponds to the circumcenter O.

aVIn elementary geometry, orthogonal is the same as perpendicular. Two lines or curves are orthogonal if they are perpendicular at their point of intersection. Two vectors v and w of the real plane R^2 or the real space R^3 are orthogonal iff their dot product v·w = 0. This condition has been exploited to define orthogonality in the more abstract context of the n-dimensional real space R^n.

aVOrthogonal circles are orthogonal curves, i.e., they cut one another at right angles. By the Pythagorean theorem, two circles of radii r_1 and r_2 whose centers are a distance d apart are orthogonal if\u000ar_1^2 + r_2^2 = d^2 .\u000aTwo circles with Cartesian equations\u000ax^2 + y^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c | = | 0\u000ax^2 + y^2 + 2g' x + 2f' y + c' | = | 0\u000aare orthogonal if\u000a2gg' + 2ff' = c + c' .

aVA n×n matrix A is an orthogonal matrix if\u000aAA^T = I, where A^T is the transpose of A and I is the identity matrix. In particular, an orthogonal matrix is always invertible, and\u000aA^(-1) = A^T .\u000aIn component form, (a^(-1))_(ij) = a_(ji) .\u000aThis relation make orthogonal matrices particularly easy to compute with, since the transpose operation is much simpler than computing an inverse.

aVA projection of a figure by parallel rays. In such a projection, tangencies are preserved. Parallel lines project to parallel lines. The ratio of lengths of parallel segments is preserved, as is the ratio of areas.\u000aAny triangle can be positioned such that its shadow under an orthogonal projection is equilateral. Also, the triangle medians of a triangle project to the triangle medians of the image triangle. Ellipses project to ellipses, and any ellipse can be projected to form a circle. The center of an ellipse projects to the center of the image ellipse. The triangle centroid of a triangle projects to the triangle centroid of its image. Under an orthogonal transformation, the Steiner inellipse can be transformed into a circle inscribed in an equilateral triangle.

aVThe osculating circle of a curve C at a given point P is the circle that has the same tangent as C at point P as well as the same curvature. Just as the tangent line is the line best approximating a curve at a point P, the osculating circle is the best circle that approximates the curve at P.\u000aIgnoring degenerate curves such as straight lines, the osculating circle of a given curve at a given point is unique.

Let z be a point on the osculating plane, then\u000a[(z - x), x', x''] = 0, where [A, B, C] denotes the scalar triple product. The osculating plane passes through the tangent. The intersection of the osculating plane with the normal plane is known as the (principal) normal vector. The vectors T and N (tangent vector and normal vector) span the osculating plane.

aVAn inner automorphism of a group G is an automorphism of the form \u03d5(g) = h^(-1) gh, where h is a fixed element of G. An outer automorphism of G is an automorphism which cannot be expressed in this form for h element G, but can be so expressed if h belongs to a larger group containing G.\u000aFor example, the automorphism of the symmetric group S_3 which maps the permutation (123) to (132) is an inner automorphism, since (132) = (12)(123)(12). However, it is an outer automorphism of the alternating group A_3 since (12) does not belong to A_3 and there is no element h of A_3 such that (132) = h^(-1)(123) h.

aVAn out-shuffle, also known as a perfect shuffle, is a riffle shuffle in which the top half of the deck is placed in the right hand, and cards are then alternatively interleaved from the right and left hands. In other words, an out-shuffle on a deck of 2n cards separates the bottom n cards from the top n cards and precisely interleaves them, with the bottom card remaining on the bottom.\u000aUsing an out-shuffle, a deck originally arranged as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 would become 1 5 2 6 3 7 4 8. The ordering of a deck of 52 cards after an out-shuffle is given by 1, 27, 2, 28, 3, 29, ... (OEIS A059953).\u000aOut-shuffling an even number n cards n - 2 times when n - 1 is prime results in the original order.

aVGiven a function f with associated Taylor series A(x) = sum_(j = 0)^\u221e a_j x^j, the Padé approximants to f are a collection of rational approximations devised to provide accurate estimations of f by way of matching A as long as is mathematically feasible and deviating onward in order to avoid perpetuation of error. In particular, the [L, M] Padé approximant to f is defined to be the rational function P_L(x)/Q_M(x), where P_L(x) = p_0 + p_1 x + ... + p_L x^L and Q_M(x) = q_0 + q_1 x + ... + q_M x^M are polynomials of degree at most L and M, respectively, which satisfies the asymptotic relation\u000aA(x) - P_L(x)/Q_M(x) = O(x^(L + M + 1)).\u000aThis asymptotic relation uniquely determines the coefficients p_i and q_j, i = 0, 1, ..., L, j = 0, 1, ..., M, the association of which can be written out algorithmically as follows: Define a_n congruent 0 if n<0, q_j congruent 0 if j>M, and\u000aa_0 | = | p_0\u000aa_1 + a_0 q_1 | = | p_1\u000aa_2 + a_1 q_1 + a_0 q_2 | = | p_2\u000a\u22ee | | \u22ee\u000aa_L + a_(L - 1) q_1 + ... + a_0 q_L | = | p_L\u000aa_(L + 1) + a_L q_1 + ... + a_(L - M + 1) q_M | = | 0\u000a\u22ee | | \u22ee\u000aa_(L + M) + a_(L + M - 1) q_1 + ... + a_L q_M | = | 0.\u000aNote that the above procedure is what remains when the normalization assumption Q_M(0) = 1 is made; this is assumed in several modern contexts though is often omitted in classical literature on the subject.

aVA p-adic number is an extension of the field of rationals such that congruences modulo powers of a fixed prime p are related to proximity in the so called "p-adic metric."\u000aAny nonzero rational number x can be represented by\u000ax = (p^a r)/s, where p is a prime number, r and s are integers not divisible by p, and a is a unique integer.

This is the same recurrence relation as for the Perrin sequence, but with different initial conditions.\u000aThe recurrence relation can be solved explicitly, giving\u000aP(n) = (1 + r_1)/(r_1^(n + 2)(2 + 3r_1)) + (1 + r_2)/(r_2^(n + 2)(2 + 3r_2)) + (1 + r_3)/(r_3^(n + 2)(2 + 3r_3)), where r_n is the nth root of\u000ax^3 + x^2 - 1 = 0.

aVA pairing function is a function that reversibly maps Z^*×Z^* onto Z^*, where Z^* = {0, 1, 2, ...} denotes nonnegative integers. Pairing functions arise naturally in the demonstration that the cardinalities of the rationals Q and the nonnegative integers Z^* are the same, i.e., left bracketing bar Q right bracketing bar = left bracketing bar Z^* right bracketing bar = \u2135_0, where \u2135_0 is known as aleph-0, originally due to Georg Cantor. Pairing functions also arise in coding problems, where a vector of integer values is to be folded onto a single integer value reversibly.

aVThe Paley graph of order q with q a prime power is a graph on q nodes with two nodes adjacent if their difference is a square in the finite field GF(q).

aVA palindromic prime is a number that is simultaneously palindromic and prime. The first few (base-10) palindromic primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 101, 131, 151, 181, 191, 313, 353, 373, 383, 727, 757, 787, ... (OEIS A002385; Beiler 1964, p. 228). The number of palindromic primes less than a given number are illustrated in the plot above. The number of palindromic numbers having n = 1, 2, 3, ... digits are 4, 1, 15, 0, 93, 0, 668, 0, 5172, 0, ... (OEIS A016115; De Geest) and the total number of palindromic primes less than 10, 10^2, 10^3, ... are 4, 5, 20, 20, 113, 113, 781, ... (OEIS A050251). Gupta has computed the numbers of palindromic primes up to 10^21.

aVA number is said to be pandigital if it contains each of the digits from 0 to 9 (and whose leading digit must be nonzero). However, "zeroless" pandigital quantities contain the digits 1 through 9. Sometimes exclusivity is also required so that each digit is restricted to appear exactly once. For example, 6729/13458 is a (zeroless, restricted) pandigital fraction and 1023456789 is the smallest (zerofull) pandigital number.\u000aThe first few zerofull restricted pandigital numbers are 1023456789, 1023456798, 1023456879, 1023456897, 1023456978, ... (OEIS A050278). A 10-digit pandigital number is always divisible by 9 since\u000a sum_(i = 0)^9 i = 45.

aVStarting with the circle P_1 tangent to the three semicircles forming the arbelos, construct a chain of tangent circles P_i, all tangent to one of the two small interior circles and to the large exterior one. This chain is called the Pappus chain.\u000aIn a Pappus chain, the distance from the center of the first inscribed circle P_1 to the bottom line is twice the circle's radius, from the second circle P_2 is four times the radius, and for the nth circle P_n is 2n times the radius. Furthermore, the centers of the circles P_i lie on an ellipse.

aVA parabola (plural "parabolas"; Gray 1997, p. 45) is the set of all points in the plane equidistant from a given line L (the conic section directrix) and a given point F not on the line (the focus). The focal parameter (i.e., the distance between the directrix and focus) is therefore given by p = 2a, where a is the distance from the vertex to the directrix or focus. The surface of revolution obtained by rotating a parabola about its axis of symmetry is called a paraboloid.

aVTwo lines in two-dimensional Euclidean space are said to be parallel if they do not intersect. In three-dimensional Euclidean space, parallel lines not only fail to intersect, but also maintain a constant separation between points closest to each other on the two lines. Lines in three-space that are not parallel but do not intersect are called skew lines.\u000aIf lines L_1 and L_2 are parallel, the notation L_1 \u2225L_2 is used.\u000aIn a non-Euclidean geometry, the concept of parallelism must be modified from its intuitive meaning. This is accomplished by changing the so-called parallel postulate. While this has counterintuitive results, the geometries so defined are still completely self-consistent.

aVThe parity of an integer is its attribute of being even or odd. Thus, it can be said that 6 and 14 have the same parity (since both are even), whereas 7 and 12 have opposite parity (since 7 is odd and 12 is even).\u000aA different type of parity of an integer n is defined as the sum s_2(n) of the bits in binary representation, i.e., the digit count N_1(n), computed modulo 2. So, for example, the number 10 = 1010_2 has two 1s in its binary representation and hence has parity 2 (mod 2), or 0. The parities of the first few integers (starting with 0) are therefore 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, ... (OEIS A010060), as summarized in the following table.

aVA partition is a way of writing an integer n as a sum of positive integers where the order of the addends is not significant, possibly subject to one or more additional constraints. By convention, partitions are normally written from largest to smallest addends, for example, 10 = 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1. All the partitions of a given positive integer n can be generated in the Wolfram Language using IntegerPartitions[list]. PartitionQ[p] in the Wolfram Language package Combinatorica \u0300 can be used to test if a list consists of positive integers and therefore is a valid partition.
p1313
aVP(n), sometimes also denoted p(n), gives the number of ways of writing the integer n as a sum of positive integers, where the order of addends is not considered significant. By convention, partitions are usually ordered from largest to smallest. For example, since 4 can be written\u000a4 | = | 4\u000a | = | 3 + 1\u000a | = | 2 + 2\u000a | = | 2 + 1 + 1\u000a | = | 1 + 1 + 1 + 1,

(Note that if "k or fewer" is changed to "exactly k" and "no element greater than k" to "greatest element equal to k, " then the partition function P of two arguments is obtained.)\u000aThe q(n, k) such partitions can be enumerated in the Wolfram Language using IntegerPartitions[n, k].

aVGiven a smooth manifold M with an open cover U_i, a partition of unity subject to the cover U_i is a collection of smooth, nonnegative functions \u03c8_i, such that the support of \u03c8_i is contained in U_i and sum_i \u03c8_i = 1 everywhere. Often one requires that the U_i have compact closure, which can be interpreted as finite, or bounded, open sets. In the case that the U_i is a locally finite cover, any point x element M has only finitely many i with \u03c8_i(x)!=0.

aVThe lines containing the three points of the intersection of the three pairs of opposite sides of a (not necessarily regular) hexagon.\u000aThere are 6! (i.e., 6 factorial) possible ways of taking all polygon vertices in any order, but among these are six equivalent cyclic permutations and two possible orderings, so the total number of different hexagons (not all simple) is\u000a(6!)/(2·6) = 720/12 = 60.\u000aThere are therefore a total of 60 Pascal lines created by connecting polygon vertices in any order.

aVThe dual of Brianchon's theorem, discovered by B. Pascal in 1640 when he was just 16 years old. It states that, given a (not necessarily regular, or even convex) hexagon inscribed in a conic section, the three pairs of the continuations of opposite sides meet on a straight line, called the Pascal line.\u000aIn 1847, Möbius published the following generalization of Pascal's theorem: if all intersection points (except possibly one) of the lines prolonging two opposite sides of a (4n + 2)-gon inscribed in a conic section are collinear, then the same is true for the remaining point.

aVPascal's triangle is a number triangle with numbers arranged in staggered rows such that\u000aa_(nr) congruent (n!)/(r!(n - r)!) congruent (n\u000ar), where (n\u000ar) is a binomial coefficient. The triangle was studied by B. Pascal, although it had been described centuries earlier by Chinese mathematician Yanghui (about 500 years earlier, in fact) and the Persian astronomer-poet Omar Khayyám. It is therefore known as the Yanghui triangle in China.

aVA linkage with six rods which draws the inverse of a given curve. When a pencil is placed at P, the inverse is drawn at P' (or vice versa). If a seventh rod (dashed) is added (with an additional pivot), P is kept on a circle and the locus traced out by P' is a straight line. It therefore converts circular motion to linear motion without sliding, and was discovered in 1864. Another linkage which performs this feat using hinged squares had been published by Sarrus in 1853 but ignored. Coxeter shows that\u000aOP×OP' = OA^2 - PA^2 .

aVThe pedal of a curve C with respect to a point O is the locus of the foot of the perpendicular from O to the tangent to the curve. More precisely, given a curve C, the pedal curve P of C with respect to a fixed point O (called the pedal point) is the locus of the point P of intersection of the perpendicular from O to a tangent to C. The parametric equations for a curve (f(t), g(t)) relative to the pedal point (x_0, y_0) are given by

aVA game played on a board of a given shape consisting of a number of holes of which all but one are initially filled with pegs. The goal is to remove all pegs but one by jumping pegs from one side of an occupied peg hole to an empty space, removing the peg which was jumped over.\u000aOne of the most common configurations is a cross-shaped board with 33 holes. All holes but the middle one are initially filled with pegs. Strategies and symmetries are discussed by Gosper et al. (1972). Berlekamp et al. (1982) give a complete solution of the puzzle.

aVThe Penrose tiles are a pair of shapes that tile the plane only aperiodically (when the markings are constrained to match at borders). These two tiles, illustrated above, are called the "kite" and "dart, " respectively. In strict Penrose tiling, the tiles must be placed in such a way that the colored markings agree; in particular, the two tiles may not be combined into a rhombus.\u000aTwo additional types of Penrose tiles known as the rhombs (of which there are two varieties: fat and skinny) and the pentacles (or which there are six type) are sometimes also defined that have slightly more complicated matching conditions.

aVThe Penrose triangle, also called the tribar (Cerf), tri-bar, impossible tribar, or impossible triangle, is an impossible figure published by Penrose and Penrose. Penrose triangles appear prominently in the works of Escher, who not only inspired creation of this object (Escher 1954, Penrose and Penrose 1958), but also subsequently publicized it.\u000aThe Penrose triangle can be extended to n-gonal barred objects (Cerf, Elber), including the so-called tribox.\u000aThe figure was drawn earlier by artist Oscar Reutersvärd in 1934 during a "long lecture." For this, he was honored with a stamp by the government of Sweden in 1982 (Miller).

aVThere are at least 15 classes of convex pentagonal tilings, as illustrated above. The first five were discovered during investigations of German mathematician Karl Reinhardt in 1918. After a gap of 50 years, R. B. Kershner found three more in 1968. Richard James subsequently discovered a ninth type of pentagonal tiling in 1975 and over the next few years, Marjorie Rice discovered another four types. Rolf Stein found a 14th tiling in 1985. The most recently discovered 15th tiling was found by Casey Mann, Jennifer McLoud and David Von Derau of the University of Washington Bothell in 2015 using a computer to exhaustively search through a large but finite set of possibilities.

aVThe use of percentages is a way of expressing ratios in terms of whole numbers. A ratio or fraction is converted to a percentage by multiplying by 100 and appending a "percentage sign" %. For example, if an investment grows from P = 13. to A = 22.5, then A is 22.5/13. = 1.7308 times as much as P, i.e., 173.08% of P. So it is also true that the investment has grown by 173.08% - 100% = 73.08%. A change of a certain percent n is sometimes said to be a change of percentage points.

aVA perfect magic cube is a magic cube for which the rows, columns, pillars, space diagonals, and diagonals of each n×n orthogonal slice sum to the same number (i.e., the magic constant M_3(n)). While this terminology is standard in the published literature (Gardner 1976, Benson and Jacoby 1981, Gardner 1988, Pickover 2002), it has been suggested at various times that such cubes instead be termed Myers cubes, Myers diagonal cubes, or diagonal magic cube (Heinz).

aVA permutation, also called an "arrangement number" or "order, " is a rearrangement of the elements of an ordered list S into a one-to-one correspondence with S itself. The number of permutations on a set of n elements is given by n! (n factorial; Uspensky 1937, p. 18). For example, there are 2! = 2·1 = 2 permutations of {1, 2}, namely {1, 2} and {2, 1}, and 3! = 3·2·1 = 6 permutations of {1, 2, 3}, namely {1, 2, 3}, {1, 3, 2}, {2, 1, 3}, {2, 3, 1}, {3, 1, 2}, and {3, 2, 1}. The permutations of a list can be found in the Wolfram Language using the command Permutations[list]. A list of length n can be tested to see if it is a permutation of 1, ..., n in the Wolfram Language using the command PermutationListQ[list].\u000aSedgewick summarizes a number of algorithms for generating permutations, and identifies the minimum change permutation algorithm of Heap to be generally the fastest. Another method of enumerating permutations was given by Johnson (1963; Séroul 2000, pp. 213-218).\u000aThe number of ways of obtaining an ordered subset of k elements from a set of n elements is given by\u000a_n P_k congruent (n!)/((n - k)!)\u000a(Uspensky 1937, p. 18), where n! is a factorial. For example, there are 4!/2! = 12 2-subsets of {1, 2, 3, 4}, namely {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 1}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 1}, {3, 2}, {3, 4}, {4, 1}, {4, 2}, and {4, 3}. The unordered subsets containing k elements are known as the k-subsets of a given set.\u000aA representation of a permutation as a product of permutation cycles is unique (up to the ordering of the cycles). An example of a cyclic decomposition is the permutation {4, 2, 1, 3} of {1, 2, 3, 4}. This is denoted (2)(143), corresponding to the disjoint permutation cycles (2) and (143). There is a great deal of freedom in picking the representation of a cyclic decomposition since (1) the cycles are disjoint and can therefore be specified in any order, and (2) any rotation of a given cycle specifies the same cycle. Therefore, (431)(2), (314)(2), (143)(2), (2)(431), (2)(314), and (2)(143) all describe the same permutation.\u000aAnother notation that explicitly identifies the positions occupied by elements before and after application of a permutation on n elements uses a 2×n matrix, where the first row is (123...n) and the second row is the new arrangement. For example, the permutation which switches elements 1 and 2 and fixes 3 would be written as\u000a[1 | 2 | 3\u000a2 | 1 | 3].\u000aAny permutation is also a product of transpositions. Permutations are commonly denoted in lexicographic or transposition order. There is a correspondence between a permutation and a pair of Young tableaux known as the Schensted correspondence.\u000aThe number of wrong permutations of n objects is [n!/e] where [x] is the nearest integer function. A permutation of n ordered objects in which no object is in its natural place is called a derangement (or sometimes, a complete permutation) and the number of such permutations is given by the subfactorial !n.\u000aUsing\u000a(x + y)^n = sum_(r = 0)^n(n\u000ar) x^(n - r) y^r\u000awith x = y = 1 gives\u000a2^n = sum_(r = 0)^n(n\u000ar), so the number of ways of choosing 0, 1, ..., or n at a time is 2^n.\u000aThe set of all permutations of a set of elements 1, ..., n can be obtained using the following recursive procedure\u000a | 1 | 2\u000a | / | \u000a2 | 1 | \u000a | 1 | | 2 | 3\u000a | | | / | \u000a | 1 | 3 | 2 | \u000a | / | | | \u000a3 | 1 | | 2 | \u000a| | | | | \u000a3 | 2 | | 1 | \u000a | \u005c | | | \u000a | 2 | 3 | 1 | \u000a | | | \u005c | \u000a | 2 | | 1 | 3\u000aConsider permutations in which no pair of consecutive elements (i.e., rising or falling successions) occur. For n = 1, 2, ... elements, the numbers of such permutations are 1, 0, 0, 2, 14, 90, 646, 5242, 47622, ... (OEIS A002464).\u000aLet the set of integers 1, 2, ..., N be permuted and the resulting sequence be divided into increasing runs. Denote the average length of the nth run as N approaches infinity, L_n.

aVA permutation cycle is a subset of a permutation whose elements trade places with one another. Permutations cycles are called "orbits" by Comtet. For example, in the permutation group {4, 2, 1, 3}, (143) is a 3-cycle and (2) is a 1-cycle. Here, the notation (143) means that starting from the original ordering {1, 2, 3, 4}, the first element is replaced by the fourth, the fourth by the third, and the third by the first, i.e., 1->4->3->1.

aVTwo lines, vectors, planes, etc., are said to be perpendicular if they meet at a right angle. In R^n, two vectors a and b are perpendicular if their dot product\u000aa·b = 0.\u000aIn R^2, a line with slope m_2 = - 1/m_1 is perpendicular to a line with slope m_1. Perpendicular objects are sometimes said to be "orthogonal."\u000aIn the above figure, the line segment AB is perpendicular to the line segment CD. This relationship is commonly denoted with a small square at the vertex where perpendicular objects meet, as shown above, and is denoted AB\u22a5CD.
p1356
aVA perpendicular bisector CD of a line segment AB is a line segment perpendicular to AB and passing through the midpoint M of AB. The perpendicular bisector of a line segment can be constructed using a compass by drawing circles centered at A and B with radius AB and connecting their two intersections. This line segment crosses AB at the midpoint M of AB (middle figure). If the midpoint M is known, then the perpendicular bisector can be constructed by drawing a small auxiliary circle around M, then drawing an arc from each endpoint that crosses the line AB at the farthest intersection of the circle with the line (i.e., arcs with radii AA' and BB' respectively). Connecting the intersections of the arcs then gives the perpendicular bisector CD. Note that if the classical construction requirement that compasses be collapsible is dropped, then the auxiliary circle can be omitted and the rigid compass can be used to immediately draw the two arcs using any radius larger that half the length of AB.\u000aThe perpendicular bisectors of a triangle \u0394A_1 A_2 A_3 are lines passing through the midpoint M_i of each side which are perpendicular to the given side. A triangle's three perpendicular bisectors meet at a point O known as the circumcenter, which is also the center of the triangle's circumcircle.

aVPerspective is the art and mathematics of realistically depicting three-dimensional objects in a two-dimensional plane, sometimes called centric or natural perspective to distinguish it from bicentric perspective.

aVErd\u0151s and Rényi showed that for many monotone-increasing properties of random graphs, graphs of a size slightly less than a certain threshold are very unlikely to have the property, whereas graphs with a few more graph edges are almost certain to have it.

aVThe beautiful arrangement of leaves in some plants, called phyllotaxis, obeys a number of subtle mathematical relationships. For instance, the florets in the head of a sunflower form two oppositely directed spirals: 55 of them clockwise and 34 counterclockwise. Surprisingly, these numbers are consecutive Fibonacci numbers. The ratios of alternate Fibonacci numbers are given by the convergents to \u03d5^(-2), where \u03d5 is the golden ratio, and are said to measure the fraction of a turn between successive leaves on the stalk of a plant: 1/2 for elm and linden, 1/3 for beech and hazel, 2/5 for oak and apple, 3/8 for poplar and rose, 5/13 for willow and almond, etc. (Coxeter 1969, Ball and Coxeter 1987). A similar phenomenon occurs for daisies, pineapples, pinecones, cauliflowers, and so on.\u000aLilies, irises, and the trillium have three petals; columbines, buttercups, larkspur, and wild rose have five petals; delphiniums, bloodroot, and cosmos have eight petals; corn marigolds have 13 petals; asters have 21 petals; and daisies have 34, 55, or 89 petals--all Fibonacci numbers.

Pie charts are implemented in the Wolfram Language as PieChart[data].

aVThere are many formulas of \u03c0 of many types. Among others, these include series, products, geometric constructions, limits, special values, and pi iterations.\u000a\u03c0 is intimately related to the properties of circles and spheres.

aVA planar embedding of a planar graph is called a planar drawing, or sometimes a "plane graph", "plane drawing" or "planar embedding."\u000aA planar straight line drawing of a planar graph can be constructed in the Wolfram Language using the PlanarEmbedding option to GraphLayout or using PlanarGraph[g].\u000aPrecomputed planar embeddings of some graphs are available in the Wolfram Language as GraphData[g, Images, Planar].

aVA graph is planar if it can be drawn in a plane without graph edges crossing (i.e., it has graph crossing number 0). The number of planar graphs with n = 1, 2, ... nodes are 1, 2, 4, 11, 33, 142, 822, 6966, 79853, ... (OEIS A005470; Wilson 1975, p. 162), the first few of which are illustrated above.\u000aThe corresponding numbers of planar connected graphs are 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 20, 99, 646, 5974, 71885, ... (OEIS A003094; Steinbach 1990, p. 131)\u000aNote that while graph planarity is an inherent property of a graph, it is still sometimes possible to draw nonplanar embeddings of planar graphs. For example, the two embeddings above both correspond to the planar tetrahedral graph, but while the left embedding is planar, the right embedding is not.

aVA point p on a regular surface M element R^3 is said to be planar if the Gaussian curvature K(p) = 0 and S(p) = 0 (where S is the shape operator), or equivalently, both of the principal curvatures \u03ba_1 and \u03ba_2 are 0.

aVA plane curve is a curve that lies in a single plane. A plane curve may be closed or open. Curves which are interesting for some reason and whose properties have therefore been investigates are called "special" curves. Some of the most common open curves are the line, parabola, and hyperbola, and some of the most common closed curves are the circle and ellipse.

aVTwo planes always intersect in a line as long as they are not parallel. Let the planes be specified in Hessian normal form, then the line of intersection must be perpendicular to both (n_1)^^ and (n_2)^^, which means it is parallel to\u000aa = (n_1)^^x(n_2)^^ .\u000aTo uniquely specify the line, it is necessary to also find a particular point on it. This can be determined by finding a point that is simultaneously on both planes, i.e., a point x_0 that satisfies\u000a(n_1)^^·x_0 | = | -p_1\u000a(n_2)^^·x_0 | = | -p_2 .

aVA planted tree is a rooted tree whose root vertex has vertex degree 1. The number of planted trees of n nodes is T_(n - 1), where T_(n - 1) is the number of rooted trees of n - 1 vertices, so there are 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 9, 20, 48, 115, 286, 719, 1842, ... (OEIS A000081) planted trees of n = 1, 2, 3, ... vertices.

aVBubbles can meet only at angles of 120° (for three bubbles) and cos^(-1)(-1/3)\u2248109°28' 16'' (for four bubbles), where cos^(-1)(-1/3) is the supplementary angle of the tetrahedral dihedral angle. This was proved by Jean Taylor using measure theory to study area minimization. The double bubble is area minimizing, but it is not known if the triple bubble is also area minimizing. It is also unknown if empty chambers trapped inside can minimize area for n>=3 bubbles.

aVThe Platonic solids, also called the regular solids or regular polyhedra, are convex polyhedra with equivalent faces composed of congruent convex regular polygons. There are exactly five such solids: the cube, dodecahedron, icosahedron, octahedron, and tetrahedron, as was proved by Euclid in the last proposition of the Elements. The Platonic solids are sometimes also called "cosmic figures", although this term is sometimes used to refer collectively to both the Platonic solids and Kepler-Poinsot solids.

aVThe illusion that the two ends of a straight line segment passing behind an obscuring rectangle are offset when, in fact, they are aligned. The Poggendorff illusion was discovered in 1860 by physicist and scholar J. C. Poggendorff, editor of Annalen der Physik und Chemie, after receiving a letter from astronomer F. Zöllner. In his letter, Zöllner described an illusion he noticed on a fabric design in which parallel lines intersected by a pattern of short diagonal lines appear to diverge (Zöllner's illusion). Pondering this illusion, Poggendorff noticed and described another illusion resulting from the apparent misalignment of a diagonal line; an illusion which today bears his name (IllusionWorks).

aVThe Poincaré hyperbolic disk is a two-dimensional space having hyperbolic geometry defined as the disk {x element R^2 : left bracketing bar x right bracketing bar <1}, with hyperbolic metric\u000ads^2 = (dx^2 + dy^2)/(1 - x^2 - y^2)^2.

aVConsider an n-dimensional deterministic dynamical system\u000a(x^_)^. = f^_(x)\u000aand let S be an n - 1-dimensional surface of section that is traverse to the flow, i.e., all trajectories starting from S flow through it and are not parallel to it. Then a Poincaré map P is a mapping from S to itself obtained by following trajectories from one intersection of the surface S to the next. Poincaré maps are useful when studying swirling flows near periodic solutions in dynamical systems.

aVA point is a 0-dimensional mathematical object which can be specified in n-dimensional space using an n-tuple (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) consisting of n coordinates. In dimensions greater than or equal to two, points are sometimes considered synonymous with vectors and so points in n-dimensional space are sometimes called n-vectors. Although the notion of a point is intuitively rather clear, the mathematical machinery used to deal with points and point-like objects can be surprisingly slippery. This difficulty was encountered by none other than Euclid himself who, in his Elements, gave the vague definition of a point as "that which has no part."
p1388
aVA point group is a group of symmetry operations which all leave at least one point unmoved. Although an isolated object may have an arbitrary Schönflies symbol, the requirement that symmetry be present in a lattice requires that only 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6-fold symmetry axes are possible (the crystallography restriction), which restricts the number of possible so-called crystallographic point groups to 32.
p1389
aVA point lattice is a regularly spaced array of points.\u000aIn the plane, point lattices can be constructed having unit cells in the shape of a square, rectangle, hexagon, etc. Unless otherwise specified, point lattices may be taken to refer to points in a square array, i.e., points with coordinates (m, n, ...), where m, n, ... are integers. Such an array is often called a grid or a mesh.

aVThere are at least two integrals called the Poisson integral.

It can be derived from Sonine's integral. With n = 0, the integral becomes Parseval's integral.

aVA Poisson process is a process satisfying the following properties: \u000a1. The numbers of changes in nonoverlapping intervals are independent for all intervals. \u000a2. The probability of exactly one change in a sufficiently small interval h congruent 1/n is P = \u03bdh congruent \u03bd/n, where \u03bd is the probability of one change and n is the number of trials. \u000a3. The probability of two or more changes in a sufficiently small interval h is essentially 0.

aVPoker is a card game played with a normal deck of 52 cards. Sometimes, additional cards called "jokers" are also used. In straight or draw poker, each player is normally dealt a hand of five cards. Depending on the variant, players then discard and redraw cards, trying to improve their hands. Bets are placed at each discard step. The number of possible distinct five-card hands is equal to the number of possible ways of picking five cards out of a deck of 52, namely\u000aN = (52\u000a5) = 2598960, where (n\u000ak) is a binomial coefficient.

aVThe polar coordinates r (the radial coordinate) and \u03b8 (the angular coordinate, often called the polar angle) are defined in terms of Cartesian coordinates by\u000ax | = | rcos\u03b8\u000ay | = | rsin\u03b8, where r is the radial distance from the origin, and \u03b8 is the counterclockwise angle from the x-axis. In terms of x and y, r | = | sqrt(x^2 + y^2)\u000a\u03b8 | = | tan^(-1)(y/x).

aVA plot of a function expressed in polar coordinates, with radius r as a function of angle \u03b8. Polar plots can be drawn in the Wolfram Language using PolarPlot[r, {t, tmin, tmax}]. The plot above is a polar plot of the polar equation r(\u03b8) = 1 + cos\u03b8, giving a cardioid.

aVThe polar sine is a function of a vertex angle of an n-dimensional parallelotope or simplex. If the content of the parallelotope is P and the lengths of the n edges of the parallelotope that meet at vertex V_0 are E_1, E_2, ..., E_n, then the value of the polar sine of that vertex is\u000apolsinV_0 = P/( product_(k = 1)^n E_k).

aVA polar zonohedron is a convex zonohedron derived from the star which joins opposite vertices of any right n-gonal prism (for n even) or antiprism (for n odd). The faces of this zonohedron consist of n equal rhombs surrounding one vertex, n rhombs beyond these, and so on, giving n - 1 sets of n rhombs altogether that end with those surrounding the opposite vertex.\u000aThe following table summarizes the first few polar zonohedra.
p1402
aVThe word "pole" is used prominently in a number of very different branches of mathematics. Perhaps the most important and widespread usage is to denote a singularity of a complex function. In inversive geometry, the inversion pole is related to inverse points with respect to an inversion circle. The term "pole" is also used to denote the degenerate points \u03d5 = 0 and \u03d5 = \u03c0 in spherical coordinates, corresponding to the north pole and south pole respectively. "All-poles method" is an alternate term for the maximum entropy method used in deconvolution. In triangle geometry, an orthopole is the point of concurrence certain perpendiculars with respect to a triangle of a given line, and a Simson line pole is similarly defined based on the Simson line of a point with respect to a triangle. In projective geometry, the perspector is sometimes known as the perspective pole.\u000aIn complex analysis, an analytic function f is said to have a pole of order n at a point z = z_0 if, in the Laurent series, a_m = 0 for m< - n and a_(-n) !=0. Equivalently, f has a pole of order n at z_0 if n is the smallest positive integer for which (z - z_0)^n f(z) is holomorphic at z_0. A analytic function f has a pole at infinity if\u000alim_(z->\u221e) f(z) = \u221e.\u000aA nonconstant polynomial P(z) has a pole at infinity of order degP, i.e., the polynomial degree of P.\u000aThe basic example of a pole is f(z) = 1/z^n, which has a single pole of order n at z = 0. Plots of 1/z and 1/z^2 are shown above in the complex plane.\u000aFor a rational function, the poles are simply given by the roots of the denominator, where a root of multiplicity n corresponds to a pole of order n.\u000aA holomorphic function whose only singularities are poles is called a meromorphic function.\u000aRenteln and Dundes give the following (bad) mathematical jokes about poles:\u000aQ: What's the value of a contour integral around Western Europe? A: Zero, because all the Poles are in Eastern Europe.\u000aQ: Why did the mathematician name his dog "Cauchy?" A: Because he left a residue at every pole.

aVA polygonal number is a type of figurate number that is a generalization of triangular, square, etc., to an n-gon for n an arbitrary positive integer.

aVA polygonal diagonal is a line segment connecting two nonadjacent polygon vertices of a polygon. The number of ways a fixed convex n-gon can be divided into triangles by nonintersecting diagonals is C_(n - 2) (with C_(n - 3) diagonals), where C_n is a Catalan number. This is Euler's polygon division problem.

aVThe word polyhedron has slightly different meanings in geometry and algebraic geometry. In geometry, a polyhedron is simply a three-dimensional solid which consists of a collection of polygons, usually joined at their edges. The word derives from the Greek poly (many) plus the Indo-European hedron (seat). A polyhedron is the three-dimensional version of the more general polytope (in the geometric sense), which can be defined in arbitrary dimension. The plural of polyhedron is "polyhedra" (or sometimes "polyhedrons").

(OEIS A000228; Klarner 1967, Balaban and Harary 1968, Harary and Read 1970, Lunnon 1972, Gardner 1978, Knop et al. 1984, Gardner 1988), The numbers of n-polyhexes with holes for n = 6, 7, 8, ... are 1, 2, 13, 67, 404, ... (OEIS A038144; Myers), the first few of which are illustrated above.

aVA generalization of the polyominoes using a collection of equal-sized equilateral triangles (instead of squares) arranged with coincident sides. Polyiamonds are sometimes simply known as iamonds.\u000aThe top row of hexiamonds in the above figure are known as the bar, crook, crown, sphinx, snake, and yacht. The bottom row of 6-polyiamonds are known as the chevron, signpost, lobster, hook, hexagon, and butterfly.

aVThe polylogarithm Li_n(z), also known as the Jonquière's function, is the function\u000aLi_n(z) congruent sum_(k = 1)^\u221e z^k/k^n\u000adefined in the complex plane over the open unit disk. Its definition on the whole complex plane then follows uniquely via analytic continuation.\u000aNote that the similar notation Li(z) is used for the logarithmic integral.
p1422
aVA polynomial is a mathematical expression involving a sum of powers in one or more variables multiplied by coefficients. A polynomial in one variable (i.e., a univariate polynomial) with constant coefficients is given by\u000aa_n x^n + ... + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 .
p1423
aVThe highest power in a univariate polynomial is known as its degree, or sometimes "order." For example, the polynomial\u000aP(x) = a_n x^n + ... + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0\u000ais of degree n, denoted degP(x) = n. The (structural) degree of a polynomial is implemented in the Wolfram Language as Exponent[poly, x]. Richardson's theorem proves that it is recursively undecidable to determine the degree of an arbitrary polynomial.
p1424
aVAn equation of the form\u000aP(x) = 0, where P(x) is a polynomial.
p1425
aVA factor of a polynomial P(x) of degree n is a polynomial Q(x) of degree less than n which can be multiplied by another polynomial R(x) of degree less than n to yield P(x), i.e., a polynomial Q(x) such that\u000aP(x) = Q(x) R(x).\u000aFor example, since\u000ax^2 - 1 = (x + 1)(x - 1), both x - 1 and x + 1 are factors of x^2 - 1.
p1426
aVPolynomial identities involving sums and differences of like powers include
p1427
aVThe quotient of two polynomials p(x) and q(x), discarding any polynomial remainder. Polynomial quotients are implemented in the Wolfram Language as PolynomialQuotient[p, q, x], and are related to the polynomial remainder R(x) by\u000ap(x) = Q(x) q(x) + R(x).\u000aFor example, the polynomial quotient of p(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 and q(x) = x^2 - 1 is Q(x) = x^2 + x + 2, leaving remainder R(x) = 2x + 3.
p1428
aVA root of a polynomial P(z) is a number z_i such that P(z_i) = 0. The fundamental theorem of algebra states that a polynomial P(z) of degree n has n roots, some of which may be degenerate. For example, the roots of the polynomial\u000ax^3 - 2x^2 - x + 2 = (x - 2)(x - 1)(x + 1)\u000aare -1, 1, and 2. Finding roots of a polynomial is therefore equivalent to polynomial factorization into factors of degree 1.\u000aAny polynomial can be numerically factored, although different algorithms have different strengths and weaknesses.
p1429
aVA polyomino is a generalization of the domino to a collection of n squares of equal size arranged with coincident sides. Polyominos were originally called "super-dominoes" by Gardner. A polyomino with n squares is known as an n-polyomino or "n-omino."\u000aPolyominoes may be conveniently represented and visualized in the Wolfram Language using ArrayMesh.
p1430
aVIf an n-sided Poncelet transverse constructed for two given conic sections is closed for one point of origin, it is closed for any position of the point of origin. Specifically, given one ellipse inside another, if there exists one circuminscribed (simultaneously inscribed in the outer and circumscribed on the inner) n-gon, then any point on the boundary of the outer ellipse is the vertex of some circuminscribed n-gon. If the conic is taken as a circle , then a polygon which has both an incenter and a circumcenter (and for which the transversals would therefore close) is called a bicentric polygon.\u000aAmazingly, this problem is isomorphic to Gelfand's question.
p1431
aVLet a circle C_1 lie inside another circle C_2. From any point on C_2, draw a tangent to C_1 and extend it to C_2. From the point, draw another tangent, etc. For n tangents, the result is called an n-sided Poncelet transverse.\u000aIf, on the circle of circumscription there is one point of origin for which a four-sided Poncelet transverse is closed, then the four-sided transverse will also close for any other point of origin on the circle.
p1432
aVThe differential equation describing exponential growth is\u000a(dN)/(dt) = rN.\u000aThis can be integrated directly\u000a integral_(N_0)^N (dN)/N = integral_0^t rdt\u000ato give\u000aln(N/N_0) = rt, where N_0 = N(t = 0). Exponentiating, N(t) = N_0 e^(rt) .
p1433
aVThe positive integers are the numbers 1, 2, 3, ... (OEIS A000027), sometimes called the counting numbers or natural numbers, denoted Z^+.\u000aThey are the solution to the simple linear recurrence equation\u000aa_n = a_(n - 1) + 1\u000awith a_1 = 1.\u000aA plot of the first few positive integers represented as a sequence of binary bits is shown above. The top portion shows S_1 to S_255, and the bottom shows the next 510 values.
p1434
aVThe term used in physics and engineering for a harmonic function. Potential functions are extremely useful, for example, in electromagnetism, where they reduce the study of a 3-component vector field to a 1-component scalar function.
p1435
aVA power is an exponent to which a given quantity is raised. The expression x^a is therefore known as "x to the ath power." A number of powers of x are plotted above.\u000aThe power may be an integer, real number, or complex number. However, the power of a real number to a non-integer power is not necessarily itself a real number. For example, x^(1/2) is real only for x>=0.\u000aA number other than 0 taken to the power 0 is defined to be 1, which follows from the limit\u000alim_(x->0) a^x = 1.
p1436
aVThe curve with trilinear coordinates a^t :b^t :c^t for a given power t.
p1437
aVA power mean is a mean of the form\u000aM_p(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) congruent (1/n sum_(k = 1)^n a_k^p)^(1/p), where the parameter p is an affinely extended real number and all a_k >=0. A power mean is also known as a generalized mean, Hölder mean, mean of degree (or order or power) p, or power mean.
p1438
aVA power series in a variable z is an infinite sum of the form\u000a sum_(i = 0)^\u221e a_i z^i, where a_i are integers, real numbers, complex numbers, or any other quantities of a given type.\u000aPólya conjectured that if a function has a power series with integer coefficients and radius of convergence 1, then either the function is rational or the unit circle is a natural boundary (Pólya 1990, pp. 43 and 46). This conjecture was stated by G. Polya in 1916 and proved to be correct by Carlson in a result that is now regarded as a classic of early 20th century complex analysis.
p1439
aVGiven a set S, the power set of S, sometimes also called the powerset, is the set of all subsets of S. The order of a power set of a set of order n is 2^n. Power sets are larger than the sets associated with them. The power set of S is variously denoted 2^S or P(S).\u000aThe power set of a given set s can be found in the Wolfram Language using Subsets[s].
p1440
aVFor a given signal, the power spectrum gives a plot of the portion of a signal's power (energy per unit time) falling within given frequency bins. The most common way of generating a power spectrum is by using a discrete Fourier transform, but other techniques such as the maximum entropy method can also be used.
p1441
aVThe power tower of order k is defined as\u000aa\u2191\u2191k congruent a^(a^(·^(·^(·^a)))) _\ufe38_k, where \u2191 is Knuth up-arrow notation, which in turn is defined by\u000aa\u2191^n k = a\u2191^(n - 1)[a\u2191^n(k - 1)]\u000atogether with\u000aa\u2191k | = | a^k\u000aa\u2191^n 1 | = | a.
p1442
aVThe Pratt certificate is a primality certificate based on Fermat's little theorem converse. Prior to the work of Pratt, the Lucas-Lehmer test had been regarded purely as a heuristic that worked a lot of the time. Pratt showed that Lehmer's primality heuristic could be made a nondeterministic procedure by applying it recursively to the factors of n - 1. As a consequence of this result, Pratt became the first to demonstrate that the resulting tree implies that prime factorization lies in the complexity class NP.
p1443
aVConsider the expression 3×7 + 2^2. This expression has value (3×7) + (2^2) = 25 due to what is called operator precedence (or "order of operations"). Precedence of common operators is generally defined so that "higher-level" operations are performed first (i.e., advanced operations "bind more tightly")/ For simple expressions, operations are typically ordered from highest to lowest in the order: \u000a1. Parenthesization, 2. Factorial, 3. Exponentiation,
p1444
aVThe present value v_n of a single payment made at n periods in the future is\u000av_n = p/(1 + r)^n, where n is the number of periods until payment, p is the payment amount, and r is the periodic discount rate. The present value v_\u221e of equal payments made each successive period in perpetuity (a.k.a. the present value of a perpetuity) is given by\u000av_\u221e = sum_(n = 1)^\u221e p/(1 + r)^n = p/r.
p1445
aVA symbol used to distinguish one quantity x' ("x prime") from another related x. Prime marks are most commonly used to denote \u000a1. Transformed coordinates, 2. Conjugate points, 3. derivatives, 4. The complement F' of a set F, 5. As an alternate notation for transpose. \u000aOf course, the term "prime" also refers to a prime number. The Wolfram Language command giving the nth prime number is Prime[n].
p1446
aVThe prime counting function is the function \u03c0(x) giving the number of primes less than or equal to a given number x. For example, there are no primes <=1, so \u03c0(1) = 0. There is a single prime (2) <=2, so \u03c0(2) = 1. There are two primes (2 and 3) <=3, so \u03c0(3) = 2. And so on.\u000aThe notation \u03c0(n) for the prime counting function is slightly unfortunate because it has nothing whatsoever to do with the constant \u03c0 = 3.1415.... This notation was introduced by number theorist Edmund Landau in 1909 and has now become standard. In the words of Derbyshire, "I am sorry about this; it is not my fault. You'll just have to put up with it."
p1447
aVd_n congruent p_(n + 1) - p_n .\u000aThe first few values are 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 6, 2, 6, 4, 2, 4, 6, 6, ... (OEIS A001223). Rankin has shown that\u000ad_n>(clnnlnlnnlnlnlnlnn)/(lnlnlnn)^2\u000afor infinitely many n and for some constant c. At a March 2003 meeting on elementary and analytic number in Oberwolfach, Germany, Goldston and Yildirim presented an attempted proof that\u000alim inf_(n->\u221e) (p_(n + 1) - p_n)/(lnp_n) = 0\u000a(Montgomery 2003). Unfortunately, this proof turned out to be flawed.
p1448
aVA prime factor is a factor that is prime, i.e., one that cannot itself be factored. In general, a prime factorization takes the form\u000an = p_1^(\u03b1_1) p_2^(\u03b1_2) ...p_k^(\u03b1_k), where p_i are prime factors and \u03b1_i are their orders. Prime factorization can be performed in the Wolfram Language using the command FactorInteger[n], which returns a list of (p_i, \u03b1_i) pairs.\u000aThe following table gives the prime factorization for the positive integers <=50.
p1449
aVThe factorization of a number into its constituent primes, also called prime decomposition. Given a positive integer n>=2, the prime factorization is written\u000an = p_1^(\u03b1_1) p_2^(\u03b1_2) ...p_k^(\u03b1_k), where the p_is are the k prime factors, each of order \u03b1_i. Each factor p_i^(\u03b1_i) is called a primary. Prime factorization can be performed in the Wolfram Language using the command FactorInteger[n], which returns a list of (p_i, \u03b1_i) pairs.\u000aThrough his invention of the Pratt certificate, Pratt became the first to establish that prime factorization lies in the complexity class NP.
p1450
aVA prime gap of length n is a run of n - 1 consecutive composite numbers between two successive primes. Therefore, the difference between two successive primes p_k and p_(k + 1) bounding a prime gap of length n is p_(k + 1) - p_k = n, where p_k is the kth prime number. Since the prime difference function\u000ad_k congruent p_(k + 1) - p_k
p1451
aVA prime link is a link that cannot be represented as a knot sum of other links. Doll and Hoste list polynomials for oriented links of nine or fewer crossings, and Rolfsen gives a table of links with small numbers of components and crossings.\u000aThe following table summarizes the number of distinct prime k-components links having specified crossing numbers.
p1452
aVA prime number (or prime integer, often simply called a "prime" for short) is a positive integer p>1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and p itself. More concisely, a prime number p is a positive integer having exactly one positive divisor other than 1, meaning it is a number that cannot be factored. For example, the only divisors of 13 are 1 and 13, making 13 a prime number, while the number 24 has divisors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 (corresponding to the factorization 24 = 2^3·3), making 24 not a prime number. Positive integers other than 1 which are not prime are called composite numbers.
p1453
aVThe prime counting function is asymptotically given by \u03c0(n)~li(n).
p1454
aVThe prime spiral, also known as Ulam's spiral, is a plot in which the positive integers are arranged in a spiral, with primes indicated in some way along the spiral. In the right plot above, primes are indicated in red and composites are indicated in yellow.\u000aThe plot above shows a larger part of the spiral in which the primes are shown as dots.
p1455
aVA primitive right triangle is a right triangle having integer sides a, b, and c such that GCD(a, b, c) = 1, where GCD(a, b, c) is the greatest common divisor. The set of values (a, b, c) is then known as a primitive Pythagorean triple.\u000aThe smallest known area shared by three primitive right triangles is 13123110, corresponding to the triples (4485, 5852, 7373), (1380, 19019, 19069), and (3059, 8580, 9109), as discovered by C. L. Shedd in 1945.
p1456
aVA primitive root of a prime p is an integer g such that g (mod p) has multiplicative order p - 1. More generally, if GCD(g, n) = 1 (g and n are relatively prime) and g is of multiplicative order \u03d5(n) modulo n where \u03d5(n) is the totient function, then g is a primitive root of n. The first definition is a special case of the second since \u03d5(p) = p - 1 for p a prime.\u000aA primitive root of a number n (but not necessarily the smallest primitive root for composite n) can be computed in the Wolfram Language using PrimitiveRoot[n].
p1457
aVLet p_n be the nth prime, then the primorial (which is the analog of the usual factorial for prime numbers) is defined by\u000ap_n # congruent product_(k = 1)^n p_k .\u000aThe values of p_n # for n = 1, 2, ..., are 2, 6, 30, 210, 2310, 30030, 510510, ... (OEIS A002110).
p1458
aVThe maximum and minimum of the normal curvature \u03ba_1 and \u03ba_2 at a given point on a surface are called the principal curvatures. The principal curvatures measure the maximum and minimum bending of a regular surface at each point. The Gaussian curvature K and mean curvature H are related to \u03ba_1 and \u03ba_2 by\u000aK | = | \u03ba_1 \u03ba_2\u000aH | = | 1/2(\u03ba_1 + \u03ba_2).

aVThe directions in which the principal curvatures occur.

aVA general prism is a polyhedron possessing two congruent polygonal faces and with all remaining faces parallelograms (Kern and Bland 1948, p. 28; left figure).\u000aA right prism is a prism in which the top and bottom polygons lie on top of each other so that the vertical polygons connecting their sides are not only parallelograms, but rectangles. A prism that is not a right prism is known as an oblique prism. If, in addition, the upper and lower bases are rectangles, then the prism is known as a cuboid.\u000aThe regular right prisms have particularly simple nets, given by two oppositely-oriented n-gonal bases connected by a ribbon of n squares. The graph corresponding to the skeleton of a prism is known, not surprisingly, as a prism graph.
p1461
aVA polyhedron having two polygons in parallel planes as bases and triangular or trapezoidal lateral faces with one side lying in one base and the opposite polyhedron vertex or side lying in the other base. Examples include the cube, cuboid, pyramidal frustum, prism, and pyramid.\u000aLet A_1 be the area of the lower base, A_2 the area of the upper base, M the area of the midsection, and h the altitude. Then\u000aV = 1/6 h(A_1 + 4M + A_2).

aVSuppose each of two prisoners A and B, who are not allowed to communicate with each other, is offered freedom in exchange for implicating the other. If neither implicates the other, both will receive the usual sentence. However, if the prisoners implicate each other, then both are presumed guilty and granted harsh sentences. A dilemma arises in deciding the best course of action in the absence of knowledge of the other prisoner's decision. Each prisoner's best strategy would appear to be to turn the other in, because in each one's worst-case assumption that the other will turn him in, remaining silent means staying stuck in jail while the other walks free.
p1463
aVProbability is the branch of mathematics that studies the possible outcomes of given events together with the outcomes' relative likelihoods and distributions. In common usage, the word "probability" is used to mean the chance that a particular event (or set of events) will occur expressed on a linear scale from 0 (impossibility) to 1 (certainty), also expressed as a percentage between 0 and 100%. The analysis of events governed by probability is called statistics.
p1464
aVFor f and g two differentiable functions, d(f(x)g(x))/ dx = f(x)g'(x) + g(x)f'(x), where f'(x) = df/ dx denotes the derivative of f with respect to x.

aVA projection is the transformation of points and lines in one plane onto another plane by connecting corresponding points on the two planes with parallel lines. This can be visualized as shining a (point) light source (located at infinity) through a translucent sheet of paper and making an image of whatever is drawn on it on a second sheet of paper. The branch of geometry dealing with the properties and invariants of geometric figures under projection is called projective geometry.
p1466
aVA projection matrix P is an n×n square matrix that gives a vector space projection from R^n to a subspace W. The columns of P are the projections of the standard basis vectors, and W is the image of P. A square matrix P is a projection matrix iff P^2 = P.\u000aA projection matrix P is orthogonal iff\u000aP = P^*, where P^* denotes the adjoint matrix of P. A projection matrix is a symmetric matrix iff the vector space projection is orthogonal.
p1467
aVThe branch of geometry dealing with the properties and invariants of geometric figures under projection. In older literature, projective geometry is sometimes called "higher geometry, " "geometry of position, " or "descriptive geometry" (Cremona 1960, pp. v-vi).
p1468
aVA projective plane, sometimes called a twisted sphere, is a surface without boundary derived from a usual plane by addition of a line at infinity. Just as a straight line in projective geometry contains a single point at infinity at which the endpoints meet, a plane in projective geometry contains a single line at infinity at which the edges of the plane meet. A projective plane can be constructed by gluing both pairs of opposite edges of a rectangle together giving both pairs a half-twist. It is a one-sided surface, but cannot be realized in three-dimensional space without crossing itself.

aVA proof that is only based on visual elements, without any comments.\u000aAn arithmetic identity can be demonstrated by a picture showing a self-evident equality between numerical quantities. The above figure shows that the difference between the nth pentagonal number and n is equal to three times the (n - 1)th triangular number. Of course, the situation depicted is a particular case of the formula (here it corresponds to n = 5), but it is presented in a way that can be immediately generalized.\u000aAnother form of proof without words frequently used in elementary geometry is the dissection proof.

aVPropositional calculus is the formal basis of logic dealing with the notion and usage of words such as "NOT, " "OR, " "AND, " and "implies." Many systems of propositional calculus have been devised which attempt to achieve consistency, completeness, and independence of axioms. The term "sentential calculus" is sometimes used as a synonym for propositional calculus.\u000aAxioms (or their schemata) and rules of inference define a proof theory, and various equivalent proof theories of propositional calculus can be devised. The following list of axiom schemata of propositional calculus is from Kleene.

aVAn encoding which provides a bijection between the n^(n - 2) labeled trees on n nodes and strings of n - 2 integers chosen from an alphabet of the numbers 1 to n. A labeled tree can be converted to a Prüfer code using LabeledTreeToCode[g] in the Wolfram Language package Combinatorica \u0300 , and a code can be converted to a labeled tree using CodeToLabeledTree[code].

aVA shorthand name for a series with the variable k taken to a negative exponent, e.g., sum_(k = 1)^\u221e k^(-p), where p>1. p-series are given in closed form by the Riemann zeta function, sum_(k = 1)^\u221e k^(-p) = \u03b6(p).
p1476
aVA pseudoprime is a composite number that passes a test or sequence of tests that fail for most composite numbers. Unfortunately, some authors drop the "composite" requirement, calling any number that passes the specified tests a pseudoprime even if it is prime. Pomerance, Selfridge, and Wagstaff restrict their use of "pseudoprime" to odd composite numbers.\u000a"Pseudoprime" used without qualification means Fermat pseudoprime, i.e., a composite number that nonetheless satisfies Fermat's little theorem to some base or set of bases.\u000aCarmichael numbers are odd composite numbers that are Fermat pseudoprimes to every base; they are sometimes called absolute pseudoprimes.

aVThe pseudosphere is the constant negative-Gaussian curvature surface of revolution generated by a tractrix about its asymptote. It is sometimes also called the tractroid, tractricoid, antisphere, or tractrisoid.

aVIf A moves along a known curve, then P describes a pursuit curve if P is always directed toward A and A and P move with uniform velocities. Pursuit curves were considered in general by the French scientist Pierre Bouguer in 1732, and subsequently by the English mathematician Boole.\u000aUnder the name "path minimization, " pursuit curves are alluded to by math genius Charlie Eppes in the Season 2 episode "Dark Matter" of the television crime drama NUMB3RS when considering the actions of the mysterious third shooter.

aVA pyramid is a polyhedron with one face (known as the "base") a polygon and all the other faces triangles meeting at a common polygon vertex (known as the "apex"). A right pyramid is a pyramid for which the line joining the centroid of the base and the apex is perpendicular to the base. A regular pyramid is a right pyramid whose base is a regular polygon. An n-gonal regular pyramid (denoted Y_n) having equilateral triangles as sides is possible only for n = 3, 4, 5. These correspond to the tetrahedron, square pyramid, and pentagonal pyramid, respectively.\u000aA pyramid is self-dual, corresponding to the fact that a pyramid's skeleton (a wheel graph) is a self-dual graph.

aVA pyramidal frustum is a frustum made by chopping the top off a pyramid. It is a special case of a prismatoid.\u000aFor a right pyramidal frustum, let s be the slant height, h the height, p_1 the bottom base perimeter, p_2 the top base perimeter, A_1 the bottom area, and A_2 the top area. Then the surface area (of the sides) and volume of a pyramidal frustum are given by\u000aS | = | 1/2(p_1 + p_2) s\u000aV | = | 1/3 h(A_1 + A_2 + sqrt(A_1 A_2)).

aVA Pythagorean triangle is a right triangle with integer side lengths (i.e., whose side lengths (a, b, c) form a Pythagorean triple). A Pythagorean triangle with GCD(a, b, c) = 1 is known as a primitive right triangle.\u000aThe inradius r of a Pythagorean triangle is always a whole number since\u000ar = 1/2(a + b - c).
p1489
aVA Pythagorean triple is a triple of positive integers a, b, and c such that a right triangle exists with legs a, b and hypotenuse c. By the Pythagorean theorem, this is equivalent to finding positive integers a, b, and c satisfying\u000aa^2 + b^2 = c^2 .\u000aThe smallest and best-known Pythagorean triple is (a, b, c) = (3, 4, 5). The right triangle having these side lengths is sometimes called the 3, 4, 5 triangle.

aVA q-analog, also called a q-extension or q-generalization, is a mathematical expression parameterized by a quantity q that generalizes a known expression and reduces to the known expression in the limit q->1^-. There are q-analogs of the factorial, binomial coefficient, derivative, integral, Fibonacci numbers, and so on. Koornwinder, Suslov, and Bustoz, have even managed some kind of q-Fourier analysis. Note that while European writers generally prefer the British spelling "q-analogue", American authors prefer the shorter "q-analog" (Andrews et al. 1999, pp. 490 and 496). To avoid this ambiguity (as well as the pitfall that there are sometimes more than just a single q-analog), the term q-extension (Andrews et al. 1999, pp. 483, 485, 487, etc.) may be preferable.\u000aq-analogs are based on the observation that\u000alim_(q->1^-) (1 - q^\u03b1)/(1 - q) = \u03b1, and the quantity (1 - q^\u03b1)/(1 - q) is sometimes written [\u03b1]. q-analogs provided the basis for the Askey-Wilson classification of all orthogonal polynomials.\u000aA physical motivation for q-special functions is provided by generalizing the canonical commutation relation\u000axp - px = 1, where x is a generalized coordinate and p the corresponding generalized momentum, to\u000axp - qpx = 1.\u000aFor example, this immediately leads to the q-analog of the Hermite polynomial. q-analogs preserve (or change only slightly) the form of the governing functional equations, and therefore arise in many physical applications, such as exact models in statistical mechanics, noncommutative geometry, and many-particle systems.\u000aq-analogs also have a combinatorial interpretation based on the fact that one can count the elements of some set S to get the number #S. A so-called "statistic" f:S->Z can then be defined which is an integer-valued function on S and separates the elements of S into classes based on what value f takes on the elements. This relationship can be summarized by writing a polynomial in a new variable, usually taken as q, where the coefficient of q^n is #{s element S:f(s) = n}. Evaluating the polynomial at q = 1 then adds the coefficients together, returning the original #S.\u000aThe q-analog of a mathematical object is generally called the "q-object, " hence q-binomial coefficient, q-factorial, etc. There are generally several q-analogs if there is one, and there is sometimes even a multibasic analog with independent q_1, q_2, .... Other types of analogs are also defined, for example the d-analog.
p1491
aVThe q-binomial coefficient is a q-analog for the binomial coefficient, also called a Gaussian coefficient or a Gaussian polynomial. A q-binomial coefficient is given by\u000a[n\u000am]_q congruent (q)_n/((q)_m (q)_(n - m)) = product_(i = 0)^(m - 1) (1 - q^(n - i))/(1 - q^(i + 1)), where\u000a(q)_k congruent product_(m = 1)^\u221e (1 - q^m)/(1 - q^(k + m))\u000ais a q-series.

aVGiven a matrix A, its QR-decomposition is a matrix decomposition of the form\u000aA = QR, where R is an upper triangular matrix and Q is an orthogonal matrix, i.e., one satisfying\u000aQ^T Q = I, where Q^T is the transpose of Q and I is the identity matrix. This matrix decomposition can be used to solve linear systems of equations.\u000aQR decomposition is implemented in the Wolfram Language as QRDecomposition[m].

aVA q-series is series involving coefficients of the form\u000a(a;q)_n | congruent | product_(k = 0)^(n - 1)(1 - aq^k)\u000a | = | product_(k = 0)^\u221e (1 - aq^k)/(1 - aq^(k + n))\u000a | = | (a;q)_\u221e/(aq^n ;q)_\u221e\u000afor n>=1, where (a;q)_\u221e is defined as\u000a(a;q)_\u221e = product_(k = 0)^\u221e(1 - aq^k).
p1496
aVThere are several q-analogs of the sine function.

aVThe Latin prefix quadri- is used to indicate the number 4, for example, quadrilateral, quadrant, etc. However, it also very commonly used to denote objects involving the number 2. This is the case because quadratum is the Latin word for square, and since the area of a square of side length x is given by x^2, a polynomial equation having exponent two is known as a quadratic ("square-like") equation. By extension, a quadratic surface is a second-order algebraic surface.
p1498
aVA quadratic equation is a second-order polynomial equation in a single variable x\u000aax^2 + bx + c = 0, with a!=0. Because it is a second-order polynomial equation, the fundamental theorem of algebra guarantees that it has two solutions. These solutions may be both real, or both complex.
p1499
aVAn algebraic integer of the form a + bsqrt(D) where D is squarefree forms a quadratic field and is denoted Q(sqrt(D)). If D>0, the field is called a real quadratic field, and if D<0, it is called an imaginary quadratic field. The integers in Q(sqrt(1)) are simply called "the" integers. The integers in Q(sqrt(-1)) are called Gaussian integers, and the integers in Q(sqrt(-3)) are called Eisenstein integers. The algebraic integers in an arbitrary quadratic field do not necessarily have unique factorizations. For example, the fields Q(sqrt(-5)) and Q(sqrt(-6)) are not uniquely factorable, since\u000a21 = 3·7 = (1 + 2sqrt(-5))(1 - 2sqrt(-5))\u000a6 = - sqrt(-6)(sqrt(-6)) = 2·3, although the above factors are all primes within these fields. All other quadratic fields Q(sqrt(D)) with left bracketing bar D right bracketing bar <=7 are uniquely factorable.\u000aQuadratic fields obey the identities\u000a(a + bsqrt(D)) ± (c + dsqrt(D)) = (a ± c) + (b ± d) sqrt(D)\u000a(a + bsqrt(D))(c + dsqrt(D)) = (ac + bdD) + (ad + bc) sqrt(D), and\u000a(a + bsqrt(D))/(c + dsqrt(D)) = (ac - bdD)/(c^2 - d^2 D) + (bc - ad)/(c^2 - d^2 D) sqrt(D).\u000aThe integers in the real field Q(sqrt(D)) are of the form r + s\u03c1, where\u000a\u03c1 = {sqrt(D) | for D congruent 2 or D congruent 3 (mod 4)\u000a1/2(-1 + sqrt(D)) | for D congruent 1 (mod 4). auto right match \u000aThere are exactly 21 quadratic fields in which there is a Euclidean algorithm, corresponding to Q(m) for squarefree integers -11, -7, -3, -2, -1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 57, and 73 (A048981). This list was published by Inkeri, but erroneously included the spurious additional term 97.

aVA quadratic form involving n real variables x_1, x_2, ..., x_n associated with the n×n matrix A = a_(ij) is given by\u000aQ(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) = a_(ij) x_i x_j, where Einstein summation has been used.

aVA quadratic map is a quadratic recurrence equation of the form\u000ax_(n + 1) = a_2 x_n^2 + a_1 x_n + a_0 .\u000aWhile some quadratic maps are solvable in closed form (for example, the three solvable cases of the logistic map), most are not.\u000aA simple example of a quadratic map with a closed-form solution is\u000ax_n = x_(n - 1)^2\u000awith x_0 = 2, which has solution x_n = 2^(2^n), the first few terms of which for n = 0, 1, ... are 2, 4, 16, 256, 65536, 4294967296, ... (OEIS A001146).
p1503
aVA quadratic polynomial is a polynomial of degree 2. A univariate quadratic polynomial has the form f(x) = a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0. An equation involving a quadratic polynomial is called a quadratic equation. A closed-form solution known as the quadratic formula exists for the solutions of an arbitrary quadratic equation.
p1504
aVIf there is an integer 0<x<p such that\u000ax^2 congruent q (mod p), i.e., the congruence (-1) has a solution, then q is said to be a quadratic residue (mod p). Note that the trivial case q = 0 is generally excluded from lists of quadratic residues so that the number of quadratic residues (mod n) is taken to be one less than the number of squares (mod n). However, other sources include 0 as a quadratic residue.
p1505
aVA number of the form ± sqrt(a), where a is a positive rational number which is not the square of another rational number is called a pure quadratic surd. A number of the form a ± sqrt(b), where a is rational and sqrt(b) is a pure quadratic surd is sometimes called a mixed quadratic surd.\u000aQuadratic surds are sometimes also called quadratic irrationals.\u000aIn 1770, Lagrange proved that any quadratic surd has a regular continued fraction which is periodic after some point. This result is known as Lagrange's continued fraction theorem.

aVA second-order algebraic surface given by the general equation\u000aax^2 + by^2 + cz^2 + 2fyz + 2gzx + 2hxy + 2px + 2qy + 2rz + d = 0.\u000aQuadratic surfaces are also called quadrics, and there are 17 standard-form types. A quadratic surface intersects every plane in a (proper or degenerate) conic section. In addition, the cone consisting of all tangents from a fixed point to a quadratic surface cuts every plane in a conic section, and the points of contact of this cone with the surface form a conic section.\u000aExamples of quadratic surfaces include the cone, cylinder, ellipsoid, elliptic cone, elliptic cylinder, elliptic hyperboloid, elliptic paraboloid, hyperbolic cylinder, hyperbolic paraboloid, paraboloid, sphere, and spheroid.
p1507
aVThe quadratrix was discovered by Hippias of Elias in 430 BC, and later studied by Dinostratus in 350 BC (MacTutor Archive). It can be used for angle trisection or, more generally, division of an angle into any integral number of equal parts, and circle squaring.
p1508
aVThe word quadrature has (at least) three incompatible meanings. Integration by quadrature either means solving an integral analytically (i.e., symbolically in terms of known functions), or solving of an integral numerically (e.g., Gaussian quadrature, Newton-Cotes formulas). Ueberhuber uses the word "quadrature" to mean numerical computation of a univariate integral, and "cubature" to mean numerical computation of a multiple integral.\u000aThe word quadrature is also used to mean squaring: the construction of a square using only compass and straightedge which has the same area as a given geometric figure. If quadrature is possible for a plane figure, it is said to be quadrable.

aVA quadric is a quadratic surface. A surface of the form\u000ax^2/(a^2 + \u03b8) + y^2/(b^2 + \u03b8) + z^2/(c^2 + \u03b8) = 1\u000ais also called a quadric, and \u03b8 is said to be the parameter of the quadric.

aVThe word quantile has no fewer than two distinct meanings in probability. Specific elements x in the range of a variate X are called quantiles, and denoted x . This particular meaning has close ties to the so-called quantile function, a function which assigns to each probability p attained by a certain probability density function f = f(X) a value Q_f(p) defined by\u000aQ_f(p) = {x:Pr(X<=x) = p}.\u000aThe kth n-tile P_k is that value of x, say x_k, which corresponds to a cumulative frequency of Nk/n. If n = 4, the quantity is called a quartile, and if n = 100, it is called a percentile.

aVA quartic equation is a fourth-order polynomial equation of the form\u000az^4 + a_3 z^3 + a_2 z^2 + a_1 z + a_0 = 0.\u000aWhile some authors (Beyer 1987b, p. 34) use the term "biquadratic equation" as a synonym for quartic equation, others reserve the term for a quartic equation having no cubic term, i.e., a quadratic equation in x^2.
p1513
aVAn algebraic surface of surface order 4. Unlike cubic surfaces, quartic surfaces have not been fully classified.\u000aExamples of quartic surfaces include the apple, Bohemian dome, Cassini surface, Cayley cubic Hessian, crossed trough, cushion surface, double sphere, eight surface, elliptic torus, Goursat's surface, lemon, Menn's surface, miter surface, Nordstrand's weird surface, Peano surface, piriform surface, quartoid, Roman surface, Steiner surface types 2 and 4, tanglecube, tooth surface, and torus.

aVOne of the four divisions of observations which have been grouped into four equal-sized sets based on their statistical rank. The quartile including the top statistically ranked members is called the first quartile and denoted Q_1. The other quartiles are similarly denoted Q_2, Q_3, and Q_4. For N data points with N of the form 4n + 5 (for n = 0, 1, ...), the hinges are identical to the first and third quartiles.\u000aThe following table summarizes a number of common methods for computing the position of the first and third quartiles from a sample size n. In the table, [x] denotes the nearest integer function.

aVThe quaternions are members of a noncommutative division algebra first invented by William Rowan Hamilton. The idea for quaternions occurred to him while he was walking along the Royal Canal on his way to a meeting of the Irish Academy, and Hamilton was so pleased with his discovery that he scratched the fundamental formula of quaternion algebra, i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = - 1,

aVA qubit (or quantum bit) is the analog of a bit for quantum computation. Unlike an ordinary bit, which may only assume two possible values (usually called 0 and 1), a qubit may assume a continuum of values of the form a left bracketing bar 0\u232a + b left bracketing bar 1\u232a where a and b are arbitrary complex numbers satisfying ( left bracketing bar a right bracketing bar )^2 + ( left bracketing bar b right bracketing bar )^2 = 1.

aVQuicksort is the fastest known comparison-based sorting algorithm (on average, and for a large number of elements), requiring O(nlgn) steps. Quicksort is a recursive algorithm which first partitions an array {a_i}_(i = 1)^n according to several rules: \u000a1. Some key \u03bd is in its final position in the array (i.e., if it is the jth smallest, it is in position a_j). \u000a2. All the elements to the left of a_j are less than or equal to a_j. The elements a_1, a_2, ..., a_(j - 1) are called the "left subfile."

aVUnlike quadratic, cubic, and quartic polynomials, the general quintic cannot be solved algebraically in terms of a finite number of additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions, and root extractions, as rigorously demonstrated by Abel (Abel's impossibility theorem) and Galois. However, certain classes of quintic equations can be solved in this manner.\u000aIrreducible quintic equations can be associated with a Galois group, which may be a symmetric group S_n, metacyclic group M_n, dihedral group D_n, alternating group A_n, or cyclic group C_n, as illustrated above. Solvability of a quintic is then predicated by its corresponding group being a solvable group.

aVThe term "quotient" is most commonly used to refer to the ratio q = r/s of two quantities r and s, where s!=0.\u000aLess commonly, the term quotient is also used to mean the integer part of such a ratio. In the Wolfram Language, the command Quotient[r, s] is defined in this latter sense, returning\u000ar\u005cs = \u230ar/s\u230b, where \u230ax\u230b is the floor function. This is sometimes called integer division.

aVFor f and g two differentiable functions, d(f(x)/(g(x)))/ dx = (g(x)f'(x) - f(x)g'(x))/g(x)^2, where f'(x) = df/ dx denotes the derivative of f with respect to x.

aVThe radian is a unit of angular measure defined such that an angle of one radian subtended from the center of a unit circle produces an arc with arc length 1.\u000aA full angle is therefore 2\u03c0 radians, so there are 360° per 2\u03c0 radians, equal to 180°/\u03c0 or 57.29577951°/radian. Similarly, a right angle is \u03c0/2 radians and a straight angle is \u03c0 radians.

aVThe radical lines of three circles are concurrent in a point known as the radical center (also called the power center). This theorem was originally demonstrated by Monge. It is a special case of the three conics theorem (Evelyn et al. 1974, pp. 13 and 15).\u000aThe point of concurrence of the three radical lines of three circles is the point\u000a left bracketing bar k | k' | k''\u000am | m' | m''\u000an | n' | nn' right bracketing bar : left bracketing bar k | k' | k''\u000an | n' | n''\u000al | l' | l'' right bracketing bar : left bracketing bar k | k' | k''\u000al | l' | l''\u000am | m' | m'' right bracketing bar \u000a(Kimberling 1998, p. 225).
p1525
aVThe radical line, also called the radical axis, is the locus of points of equal circle power with respect to two nonconcentric circles. By the chordal theorem, it is perpendicular to the line of centers.\u000aLet the circles have radii r_1 and r_2 and their centers be separated by a distance d. If the circles intersect in two points, then the radical line is the line passing through the points of intersection. If not, then draw any two circles which cut each original circle twice. Draw lines through each pair of points of intersection of each circle. The line connecting their two points of intersection is then the radical line.
p1526
aVThe nth root (or "nth radical") of a quantity z is a value r such that z = r^n, and therefore is the inverse function to the taking of a power. The nth root is denoted r = z^(1/n) or, using power notation, r = z^(1/n). The special case of the square root (n = 2) is denoted sqrt(z). The case n = 3 is known as the cube root.\u000aThe quantities for which a general function equals 0 are also called roots, or sometimes zeros.\u000aThe quantities \u03b7_k such that \u03b7_k^n = 1 are called the nth roots of unity.

p1528
aVThe radius of curvature is given by\u000aR congruent 1/( left bracketing bar \u03ba right bracketing bar ), where \u03ba is the curvature. At a given point on a curve, R is the radius of the osculating circle. The symbol \u03c1 is sometimes used instead of R to denote the radius of curvature.

aVThe Radon transform is an integral transform whose inverse is used to reconstruct images from medical CT scans. A technique for using Radon transforms to reconstruct a map of a planet's polar regions using a spacecraft in a polar orbit has also been devised.\u000aThe Radon and inverse Radon transforms are implemented in the Wolfram Language as RadonTransform and InverseRadonTransform, respectively.

aVThe Ramsey number R(m, n) gives the solution to the party problem, which asks the minimum number of guests R(m, n) that must be invited so that at least m will know each other or at least n will not know each other. In the language of graph theory, the Ramsey number is the minimum number of vertices v = R(m, n) such that all undirected simple graphs of order v contain a clique of order m or an independent set of order n. Ramsey's theorem states that such a number exists for all m and n.\u000aBy symmetry, it is true that\u000aR(m, n) = R(n, m).

aVA random graph is a graph in which properties such as the number of graph vertices, graph edges, and connections between them are determined in some random way. The graphs illustrated above are random graphs on 10 vertices with edge probabilities distributed uniformly in [0, 1].\u000aErd\u0151s and Rényi showed that for many monotone-increasing properties of random graphs, graphs of a size slightly less than a certain threshold are very unlikely to have the property, whereas graphs with a few more graph edges are almost certain to have it. This is known as a phase transition . Almost all graphs are connected and nonplanar.

aVA random variable is a measurable function from a probability space (S, S, P) into a measurable space (S', S') known as the state space. Papoulis gives the slightly different definition of a random variable X as a real function whose domain is the probability space S and such that: \u000a1. The set {X<=x} is an event for any real number x. \u000a2. The probability of the events {X = + \u221e} and {X = - \u221e} equals zero. \u000aThe abbreviation "r.v." is sometimes used to denote a random variable.

aVA random variate is a variable generated from uniformly distributed pseudorandom numbers. Depending on how they are generated, a random variate can be uniformly or nonuniformly distributed. Random variates are frequently used as the input to simulation models.

aVA random process consisting of a sequence of discrete steps of fixed length. The random thermal perturbations in a liquid are responsible for a random walk phenomenon known as Brownian motion, and the collisions of molecules in a gas are a random walk responsible for diffusion. Random walks have interesting mathematical properties that vary greatly depending on the dimension in which the walk occurs and whether it is confined to a lattice.

aVIf f:D->Y is a map (a.k.a. function, transformation, etc.) over a domain D, then the range of f, also called the image of D under f, is defined as the set of all values that f can take as its argument varies over D, i.e., Range(f) = f(D) = {f(X):X element D}.\u000aNote that among mathematicians, the word "image" is used more commonly than "range."\u000aThe range is a subset of Y and does not have to be all of Y.

aVThe ratio of two numbers r and s is written r/s, where r is the numerator and s is the denominator. The ratio of r to s is equivalent to the quotient r/s. Betting odds written as r:s correspond to s/(r + s). A number which can be expressed as a ratio of integers is called a rational number.

aVThe rational distance problem asks to find a geometric configuration satisfying given properties such that all distances along specific edges are rational numbers. (This is equivalent to having all edge lengths be integers, since the denominators of rational numbers can be cleared by multiplication.)\u000aA cuboid whose edges and face diagonals are integers is called an Euler brick. It is not known if there exists a point in a unit square all of whose distances from the corners are rational, although J. H. Conway and M.

aVA quotient of two polynomials P(z) and Q(z), R(z) congruent (P(z))/(Q(z)), is called a rational function, or sometimes a rational polynomial function. More generally, if P and Q are polynomials in multiple variables, their quotient is called a (multivariate) rational function. The term "rational polynomial" is sometimes used as a synonym for rational function. However, this usage is strongly discouraged since by analogy with complex polynomial and integer polynomial, rational polynomial should properly refer to a polynomial with rational coefficients.
p1543
aVA rational number is a number that can be expressed as a fraction p/q where p and q are integers and q!=0. A rational number p/q is said to have numerator p and denominator q. Numbers that are not rational are called irrational numbers. The real line consists of the union of the rational and irrational numbers. The set of rational numbers is of measure zero on the real line, so it is "small" compared to the irrationals and the continuum.

For example, after 668, the next iteration is given by\u000a668 + 866 = 1534, so the next term is 1345.\u000aApplied to 1, the sequence gives 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 77, 145, 668, 1345, 6677, 13444, 55778, 133345, 666677, 1333444, 5567777, 12333445, 66666677, 133333444, 556667777, 1233334444, 5566667777, 12333334444, 55666667777, 123333334444, 556666667777, 1233333334444, ...

aVA real function is said to be analytic if it possesses derivatives of all orders and agrees with its Taylor series in a neighborhood of every point.

aVThe field of all rational and irrational numbers is called the real numbers, or simply the "reals, " and denoted R. The set of real numbers is also called the continuum, denoted c. The set of reals is called Reals in the Wolfram Language, and a number x can be tested to see if it is a member of the reals using the command Element[x, Reals], and expressions that are real numbers have the Head of Real.

aVThe real projective plane is the closed topological manifold, denoted RP^2, that is obtained by projecting the points of a plane E from a fixed point P (not on the plane), with the addition of the line at infinity. It can be described by connecting the sides of a square in the orientations illustrated above (Gardner 1971, pp. 15-17; Gray 1997, pp. 323-324).
p1549
aVThe reciprocal of a real or complex number z!=0 is its multiplicative inverse 1/z = z^(-1), i.e., z to the power -1. The reciprocal of zero is undefined. A plot of the reciprocal of a real number x is plotted above for -2<=x<=2.\u000aTwo numbers are reciprocals if and only if their product is 1. To put it another way, a number and its reciprocal are inversely related. Therefore, the larger a (positive) number, the smaller its reciprocal.\u000aThe reciprocal of a complex number z = x + iy is given by\u000a1/(x + iy) = (x - iy)/(x^2 + y^2) = x/(x^2 + y^2) - y/(x^2 + y^2) i.

aVThe rectangle function \u03a0(x) is a function that is 0 outside the interval [-1/2, 1/2] and unity inside it. It is also called the gate function, pulse function, or window function, and is defined by\u000a\u03a0(x) congruent {0 | for left bracketing bar x right bracketing bar >1/2\u000a1/2 | for left bracketing bar x right bracketing bar = 1/2\u000a1 | for left bracketing bar x right bracketing bar <1/2. auto right match

aVA hyperbola for which the asymptotes are perpendicular, also called an equilateral hyperbola or right hyperbola. This occurs when the semimajor and semiminor axes are equal. This corresponds to taking a = b, giving eccentricity e = sqrt(2). Plugging a = b into the general equation of a hyperbola with semimajor axis parallel to the x-axis and semiminor axis parallel to the y-axis (i.e., vertical conic section directrix), (x - x_0)^2/a^2 - (y - y_0)^2/b^2 = 1\u000atherefore gives

aVA matrix for which horizontal and vertical dimensions are not the same (i.e., an m×n matrix with m!=n).

aVThe plane spanned by the tangent vector T and binormal vector B.

aVA recurrence plot is defined as a plot of the quantity\u000aR(t, \u03c4) = H(\u03b5 - left double bracketing bar f(t) - f(\u03c4) right double bracketing bar ), where H(x) is the Heaviside step function and left double bracketing bar f right double bracketing bar denotes a norm. A recurrence plot is therefore a binary plot. The figure above shows a recurrence plot for the Lorenz attractor with r = 28, \u03c3 = 10, b = 8/3, x(0) = 1, y(0) = 0, z(0) = 0, and \u03f5 = 5.\u000aRecurrence plots were initially used to graphically display nonstationarity in time series (Eckmann et al. 1987, Gao and Cai 2000), but are also useful for visualizing functions.
p1556
aVA mathematical relationship expressing f_n as some combination of f_i with i<n. When formulated as an equation to be solved, recurrence relations are known as recurrence equations, or sometimes difference equations.
p1557
aVA recursive process is one in which objects are defined in terms of other objects of the same type. Using some sort of recurrence relation, the entire class of objects can then be built up from a few initial values and a small number of rules. The Fibonacci numbers are most commonly defined recursively. Care, however, must be taken to avoid self-recursion, in which an object is defined in terms of itself, leading to an infinite nesting.
p1558
aVThe term "recursive function" is often used informally to describe any function that is defined with recursion. There are several formal counterparts to this informal definition, many of which only differ in trivial respects.\u000aKleene defines a "partial recursive function" of nonnegative integers to be any function f that is defined by a noncontradictory system of equations whose left and right sides are composed from (1) function symbols (for example, f, g, h, etc.), (2) variables for nonnegative integers (for example, x, y, z, etc.), (3) the constant 0, and (4) the successor function S(x) = x + 1.
p1559
aVA recursive sequence {f(n)}_n, also known as a recurrence sequence, is a sequence of numbers f(n) indexed by an integer n and generated by solving a recurrence equation. The terms of a recursive sequences can be denoted symbolically in a number of different notations, such as f_n, f(n), or f[n], where f is a symbol representing the sequence.\u000aThe idea of sequences in which later terms are deduced from earlier ones, which is implicit in the principle of mathematical induction, dates to antiquity.
p1560
aVA fraction a/b written in lowest terms, i.e., by dividing numerator and denominator through by their greatest common divisor (a, b). For example, 2/3 is the reduced fraction of 8/12.
p1561
aVA reducible fraction is a fraction p/q such that GCD(p, q)>1, i.e., p/q can be written in reduced form. A fraction that is not reducible is said to be irreducible.\u000aFor example, in the complex plane, (4 + 7i)/(2 + i) = 3 + 2i is reducible, while (5 + 5i)/(7 + i) = 4/5 + 3i/5 is not.
p1562
aVThe operation of exchanging all points of a mathematical object with their mirror images (i.e., reflections in a mirror). Objects that do not change handedness under reflection are said to be amphichiral; those that do are said to be chiral.\u000aConsider the geometry of the left figure in which a point x_1 is reflected in a mirror (blue line). Then\u000ax_r = x_0 + n^^[(x_1 - x_0)·n^^], so the reflection of x_1 is given by\u000ax_1' = - x_1 + 2x_0 + 2n^^[(x_1 - x_0)·n^^].
p1563
aVA reflex angle is an angle of more than 180°.\u000aA full angle is therefore a reflex angle, while acute, obtuse, right, and straight angles are not.
p1564
aVAn idealized computing machine consisting of a fixed set of data registers and set of instructions for operating on them. Register machines are also known as counter machines and program machines. Early investigators included Shepherdson and Sturgis and Minsky. Somewhat similar constructs were also part of Kurt Gödel's 1931 work on representing logic within arithmetic.\u000aWolfram considers machines with two registers and two operations: "increments" and "decrement-jumps." The above illustration shows 30 steps of a five-instruction program that generate nonrepetitive output.
p1565
aVA method for fitting a curve (not necessarily a straight line) through a set of points using some goodness-of-fit criterion. The most common type of regression is linear regression.\u000aThe term regression is sometimes also used to refer to recursion.

aVThe slope b of a line obtained using linear least squares fitting is called the regression coefficient.

aVA relation is any subset of a Cartesian product. For instance, a subset of A×B, called a "binary relation from A to B, " is a collection of ordered pairs (a, b) with first components from A and second components from B, and, in particular, a subset of A×A is called a "relation on A." For a binary relation R, one often writes aRb to mean that (a, b) is in R×R.
p1569
aVTwo integers are relatively prime if they share no common positive factors (divisors) except 1. Using the notation (m, n) to denote the greatest common divisor, two integers m and n are relatively prime if (m, n) = 1. Relatively prime integers are sometimes also called strangers or coprime and are denoted m\u22a5n. The plot above plots m and n along the two axes and colors a square black if (m, n) = 1 and white otherwise and simply colored according to (m, n).\u000aTwo numbers can be tested to see if they are relatively prime in the Wolfram Language using CoprimeQ[m, n].

aVRelaxation methods are methods of solving partial differential equations that involve splitting the sparse matrix that arises from finite differencing then iterating until a solution is found .
p1571
aVIn general, a remainder is a quantity "left over" after performing a particular algorithm. The term is most commonly used to refer to the number left over when two integers are divided by each other in integer division. For example, 55\u005c7 = 7, with a remainder of 6. Of course in real division, there is no such thing as a remainder since, for example, 55/7 = 7 + 6/7.\u000aThe term remainder is also sometimes applied to the residue of a congruence.
p1572
aVA repeating decimal, also called a recurring decimal, is a number whose decimal representation eventually becomes periodic (i.e., the same sequence of digits repeats indefinitely). The repeating portion of a decimal expansion is conventionally denoted with a vinculum so, for example, 1/3 = 0.333333... = 0.3^_ .\u000aThe minimum number of digits that repeats in such a number is known as the decimal period.

aVA polygon that can be dissected into n smaller copies of itself is called a rep-n-tile. The triangular polygonal spiral is also a rep-tile.\u000aThe above figure shows the zeroth through fifth iterations obtained by rep-tiling the L-shape.

aVA repunit is a number consisting of copies of the single digit 1. The term "repunit" was coined by Beiler, who also gave the first tabulation of known factors.\u000aIn base-10, repunits have the form\u000aR_n | = | (10^n - 1)/(10 - 1)\u000a | = | (10^n - 1)/9.

aVThe word residue is used in a number of different contexts in mathematics. Two of the most common uses are the complex residue of a pole, and the remainder of a congruence.\u000aThe number b in the congruence a congruent b (mod m) is called the residue of a (mod m). The residue of large numbers can be computed quickly using congruences.

aVThe reversal of a positive integer abc...z is z...cba. The reversal of a positive integer n is implemented in the Wolfram Language as IntegerReverse[n].\u000aA positive integer that is the same as its own reversal is known as a palindromic number.\u000aBall and Coxeter consider numbers whose reversals are integral multiples of themselves. Palindromic numbers and numbers ending with a zero are trivial examples.

aVReverse Polish notation (RPN) is a method for representing expressions in which the operator symbol is placed after the arguments being operated on. Polish notation, in which the operator comes before the operands, was invented in the 1920s by the Polish mathematician Jan Lucasiewicz. In the late 1950s, Australian philosopher and computer scientist Charles L. Hamblin suggested placing the operator after the operands and hence created reverse polish notation.\u000aFor example, the following RPN expression will produce the sum of 2 and 3, namely 5: 2 3 +.

aVThe sequence obtained from reversing the digits of a number n and adding the result to the original number. For n = 1, 2, ..., this gives 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 110, ... (OEIS A056964).\u000aLooking at iterations of the reverse-then-add algorithm in base-2 gives the visualizations illustrated above, it which the left plot begins with 16 and runs 250 steps and the right plot begins with 512 and runs 500 steps.\u000aApplying the reverse-then-add operating iteratively until a palindromic number is obtained is called the 196-algorithm.

aVReversion to the mean, also called regression to the mean, is the statistical phenomenon stating that the greater the deviation of a random variate from its mean, the greater the probability that the next measured variate will deviate less far. In other words, an extreme event is likely to be followed by a less extreme event.

aVThe rhombic enneacontahedron is the equilateral zonohedron constructed from the 10 diameters of the dodecahedron. This enneacontahedron somewhat resembles a figure of Sharp.\u000aIt has 90 faces, with 30 of one type and the other 60 of another.\u000aIt is implemented in the Wolfram Language as PolyhedronData[RhombicEnneacontahedron].
p1587
aVThe rhombic hexecontahedron is a 60-faced polyhedron that can be obtained by stellating the rhombic triacontahedron by placing a plane along each edge which is perpendicular to the plane of symmetry in which the edge lies, and taking the solid bounded by these planes gives a hexecontahedron. It is therefore a rhombic triacontahedron stellation. It appears to have been first noted and illustrated by Unkelbach as one of 20 finite equilateral polyhedra whose edges lie in planes of symmetry and whose faces are convex polygons which do not penetrate one another.

aVThe rhombic triacontahedron is a zonohedron which is the dual polyhedron of the icosidodecahedron A_4. It is Wenninger dual W_12. It is composed of 30 rhombi joined at 32 vertices. The intersecting edges of the dodecahedron-icosahedron compound form the diagonals of 30 rhombi which comprise the triacontahedron. The cube 5-compound has the 30 facial planes of the rhombic triacontahedron and its interior is a rhombic triacontahedron.\u000aMore specifically, a tetrahedron 10-compound, cube 5-compound, icosahedron, and dodecahedron can be inscribed in the vertices of the rhombic triacontahedron (E. Weisstein, Dec. 25-27, 2009).

Examples include the Riemann P-series, Riemann-Siegel functions, Riemann theta function, Riemann zeta function, xi-function, the function F(x) obtained by Riemann in studying Fourier series, the function R(x, y;\u03be, \u03b7) appearing in the application of the Riemann method for solving the Goursat problem, the Riemann prime counting function f(x), and the related the function R(n) obtained by replacing f(x) with li(x^(1/n)) in the Möbius inversion formula.

aVThe Riemann integral is the definite integral normally encountered in calculus texts and used by physicists and engineers. Other types of integrals exist (e.g., the Lebesgue integral), but are unlikely to be encountered outside the confines of advanced mathematics texts. In fact, according to Jeffreys and Jeffreys, "it appears that cases where these methods [i.e., generalizations of the Riemann integral] are applicable and Riemann's [definition of the integral] is not are too rare in physics to repay the extra difficulty."

aVThe Riemann sphere, also called the extended complex plane, is a one-dimensional complex manifold C^* (C-star) which is the one-point compactification of the complex numbers C^* = C union {\u221e^~}, together with two charts. (Here \u221e^~ denotes complex infinity.) The notation C^^ is also used (Krantz 1999, p. 82; Lorentzen, and Waadeland 2008, p. 3).\u000aFor all points in the complex plane, the chart is the identity map from the sphere (with infinity removed) to the complex plane. For the point at infinity, the chart neighborhood is the sphere (with the origin removed), and the chart is given by sending infinity to 0 and all other points z to 1/z.

aVLet a closed interval [a, b] be partitioned by points a<x_1<x_2<...<x_(n - 1)<b, where the lengths of the resulting intervals between the points are denoted \u0394x_1, \u0394x_2, ..., \u0394x_n. Let x_k^* be an arbitrary point in the kth subinterval. Then the quantity\u000a sum_(k = 1)^n f(x_k^*) \u0394x_k\u000ais called a Riemann sum for a given function f(x) and partition, and the value max\u0394x_k is called the mesh size of the partition.

aVA Riemann surface is a surface-like configuration that covers the complex plane with several, and in general infinitely many, "sheets." These sheets can have very complicated structures and interconnections. Riemann surfaces are one way of representing multiple-valued functions; another is branch cuts. The above plot shows Riemann surfaces for solutions of the equation\u000a[w(z)]^d + w(z) + z^(d - 1) = 0\u000awith d = 2, 3, 4, and 5, where w(z) is the Lambert W-function (M. Trott).

aVA riffle shuffle, also called the Faro shuffle, is a shuffle in which a deck of 2n cards is divided into two halves. The top half of the deck is placed in the left hand, and cards are then alternatively interleaved from the left and right hands (an in-shuffle) or from the right and left hands (an out-shuffle). Using an in-shuffle, a deck originally arranged as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 would become 5 1 6 2 7 3 8 4. Using an out-shuffle, the deck order would become 1 5 2 6 3 7 4 8. Riffle shuffles are used in card tricks (Marlo 1958ab, Adler 1973), and also in the theory of parallel processing .

aVA right angle is an angle equal to half the angle from one end of a line segment to the other. A right angle is \u03c0/2 radians or 90°. A triangle containing a right angle is called a right triangle. However, a triangle cannot contain more than one right angle, since the sum of the two right angles plus the third angle would exceed the 180° total possessed by a triangle.\u000aThe patterns of cracks observed in mud that has been dried by the sun form curves that often intersect in right angles.
p1601
aVThe rule which determines the orientation of the cross product u×v. The right-hand rule states that the orientation of the vectors' cross product is determined by placing u and v tail-to-tail, flattening the right hand, extending it in the direction of u, and then curling the fingers in the direction that the angle v makes with u. The thumb then points in the direction of u×v.\u000aA three-dimensional coordinate system in which the axes satisfy the right-hand rule is called a right-handed coordinate system, while one that does not is called a left-handed coordinate system.

aVThe word "rigid" has two different meaning when applied to a graph. Firstly, a rigid graph may refer to a graph having a graph automorphism group containing a single element.\u000aA framework (or graph) is rigid iff continuous motion of the points of the configuration maintaining the bar constraints comes from a family of motions of all Euclidean space which are distance-preserving. A graph that is not rigid is said to be flexible.

aVThe Risch algorithm is a decision procedure for indefinite integration that determines whether a given integral is elementary, and if so, returns a closed-form result for the integral. It builds a tower of logarithmic, exponential, and algebraic extensions. The case of algebraic extensions is quite complicated and is therefore not completely implemented in any computer algebra system. Liouville's principle, which dates back to the 19th century, is an important part of the Risch algorithm. There are extensions to the Risch algorithm, notably by Cherry, to be able to handle some special functions.

aVRoman numerals are a system of numerical notations used by the Romans. They are an additive (and subtractive) system in which letters are used to denote certain "base" numbers, and arbitrary numbers are then denoted using combinations of symbols. Unfortunately, little is known about the origin of the Roman numeral system.\u000aThe following table gives the Latin letters used in Roman numerals and the corresponding numerical values they represent.

aVA rooted tree is a tree in which a special ("labeled") node is singled out. This node is called the "root" or (less commonly) "eve" of the tree. Rooted trees are equivalent to oriented trees. A tree which is not rooted is sometimes called a free tree, although the unqualified term "tree" generally refers to a free tree.\u000aA rooted tree in which the root vertex has vertex degree 1 is known as a planted tree.\u000aThe numbers of rooted trees on n nodes for n = 1, 2, ... are 1, 1, 2, 4, 9, 20, 48, 115, 286, 719, 1842, 4766, ...

aVThe nth roots of unity are roots e^(2\u03c0ik/n) of the cyclotomic equation\u000ax^n = 1, which are known as the de Moivre numbers. The notations \u03b6_k, \u03f5_k, and \u03b5_k, where the value of n is understood by context, are variously used to denote the kth nth root of unity.\u000a+1 is always an nth root of unity, but -1 is such a root only if n is even. In general, the roots of unity form a regular polygon with n sides, and each vertex lies on the unit circle.

aVThe turning of an object or coordinate system by an angle about a fixed point. A rotation is an orientation-preserving orthogonal transformation. Euler's rotation theorem states that an arbitrary rotation can be parameterized using three parameters. These parameters are commonly taken as the Euler angles.

aVWhen discussing a rotation, there are two possible conventions: rotation of the axes, and rotation of the object relative to fixed axes.\u000aIn R^2, consider the matrix that rotates a given vector v_0 by a counterclockwise angle \u03b8 in a fixed coordinate system. Then\u000aR_\u03b8 = [cos\u03b8 | -sin\u03b8\u000asin\u03b8 | cos\u03b8], so\u000av' = R_\u03b8 v_0 .

aVThe process of approximating a quantity, be it for convenience or, as in the case of numerical computations, of necessity. If rounding is performed on each of a series of numbers in a long computation, roundoff error can become important, especially if division by a small number ever occurs.

aVA round number is a number that is the product of a considerable number of comparatively small factors. Round numbers are very rare. As Hardy notes, "Half the numbers are divisible by 2, one-third by 3, one-sixth by both 2 and 3, and so on. Surely, then we may expect most numbers to have a large number of factors. But the facts seem to show the opposite."
p1623
aVRoundoff error is the difference between an approximation of a number used in computation and its exact (correct) value. In certain types of computation, roundoff error can be magnified as any initial errors are carried through one or more intermediate steps.\u000aAn egregious example of roundoff error is provided by a short-lived index devised at the Vancouver stock exchange. At its inception in 1982, the index was given a value of 1000.000. After 22 months of recomputing the index and truncating to three decimal places at each change in market value, the index stood at 524.881, despite the fact that its "true" value should have been 1009.811.

aVRubik's Cube a is 3×3×3 cube in which the 26 subcubes on the outside are internally hinged in such a way that rotation (by a quarter turn in either direction or a half turn) is possible in any plane of cubes. Each of the six sides is painted a distinct color, and the goal of the puzzle is to return the cube to a state in which each side has a single color after it has been randomized by repeated rotations. The puzzle was invented in the 1970s by the Hungarian Ern\u0151 Rubik and sold millions of copies worldwide over the next decade.

aVRule 94 is one of the elementary cellular automaton rules introduced by Stephen Wolfram in 1983. It specifies the next color in a cell, depending on its color and its immediate neighbors. Its rule outcomes are encoded in the binary representation 94 = 1011110_2. This rule is illustrated above together with the evolution of a single black cell it produces after 15 steps.\u000aRule 94 is amphichiral, and its complement is 133.

aVA ruled surface is a surface that can be swept out by moving a line in space. It therefore has a parameterization of the form\u000ax(u, v) = b(u) + v\u03b4(u), where b is called the ruled surface directrix (also called the base curve) and \u03b4 is the director curve. The straight lines themselves are called rulings. The rulings of a ruled surface are asymptotic curves. Furthermore, the Gaussian curvature on a ruled regular surface is everywhere nonpositive.

Under a_0, write \u230aa_0/2\u230b, where \u230ax\u230b is the floor function, and under b_0, write 2b_0. Continue until a_i = 1. Then cross out any entries in the b column which are opposite an even number in the a column and add the b column. The result is the desired product. For example, for a = 27, b = 35

aVRussian roulette is a game of chance in which one or more of the six chambers of a revolver are filled with cartridges, the chamber is rotated at random, and the gun is fired. The shooter bets on whether the chamber which rotates into place will be loaded. If it is, he loses not only his bet but his life. In the case of a revolver with six chambers (revolvers with 5, 7, or 8 chambers are also common), the shooter has a 1/6 chance of dying (ignoring the fact that the probability of firing the round is always somewhat less than 1/n for a n-shot revolver because the mass of the round in the cylinder causes an imbalance, and the cylinder will tend to stop rotating with its heavy side at or close to the bottom, while the firing pin is opposite the top chamber).

aVA sample is a subset of a population that is obtained through some process, possibly random selection or selection based on a certain set of criteria, for the purposes of investigating the properties of the underlying parent population. In particular, statistical quantities determined directly from the sample (such as sample central moments, sample raw moments, sample mean, sample variance, etc.) can be used as estimators for the corresponding properties of the underlying distribution.\u000aThe process of obtaining a sample is known as sampling, and the number of members in a sample is called the sample size.

aVA scale-free network is a connected graph or network with the property that the number of links k originating from a given node exhibits a power law distribution P(k)~k^(-\u03b3). A scale-free network can be constructed by progressively adding nodes to an existing network and introducing links to existing nodes with preferential attachment so that the probability of linking to a given node i is proportional to the number of existing links k_i that node has, i.e., P(linking to node i)~k_i/( sum_j k_j).

aVA secant line, also simply called a secant, is a line passing through two points of a curve. As the two points are brought together (or, more precisely, as one is brought towards the other), the secant line tends to a tangent line.\u000aThe secant line connects two points (x, f(x)) and (a, f(a)) in the Cartesian plane on a curve described by a function y = f(x).

aVThe randomization of a deck of cards by repeated interleaving. More generally, a shuffle is a rearrangement of the elements in an ordered list. Shuffling by exactly interleaving two halves of a deck is called a riffle shuffle. Shuffling by successively interchanging the cards in position 1, 2, ..., n with cards in randomly chosen positions is known as an exchange shuffle. Normal shuffling leaves gaps of different lengths between the two layers of cards and so randomizes the order of the cards.\u000aKeller showed that roughly lnn shuffles are needed just to randomize the bottom card.

aVA pair of dice which have the same odds for throwing every number as a normal pair of 6-sided dice. They are the only such alternate arrangement if face values are required to be positive. However, if faces are permitted to have zero value (i.e., to be blank), then two additional possible equal-odds pairs of dice are obtained by subtracting one from each face on either of the two dice and adding one to each face the other. If negative values are permitted, there are an infinite number of equal-odds dice.

aVThe Sierpi\u0144ski sieve is a fractal described by Sierpi\u0144ski in 1915 and appearing in Italian art from the 13th century. It is also called the Sierpi\u0144ski gasket or Sierpi\u0144ski triangle. The curve can be written as a Lindenmayer system with initial string FXF--FF--FF, string rewriting rules F" -> "FF, X" -> "--FXF++FXF++FXF--, and angle 60°.\u000aThe nth iteration of the Sierpi\u0144ski sieve is implemented in the Wolfram Language as SierpinskiMesh[n].

aVA simple algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a specified integer. To apply the algorithm, sequentially write down the integers from 2 to the highest number n to be included in the table. Cross out all numbers > 2 which are divisible by 2 (every second number). Find the smallest remaining number > 2. It is 3. So cross out all numbers > 3 which are divisible by 3 (every third number). Find the smallest remaining number > 3. It is 5. So cross out all numbers > 5 which are divisible by 5 (every fifth number). Continue until you have crossed out all numbers divisible by \u230asqrt(n)\u230b. The numbers remaining are prime.

aVThe sigmoid function, also called the sigmoidal curve or logistic function, is the function\u000ay = 1/(1 + e^(-x)).
p1714
aVWhen a number is expressed in scientific notation, the number of significant digits (or significant figures) is the number of digits needed to express the number to within the uncertainty of calculation. For example, if a quantity is known to be 1.234 ± 0.002, four figures would be significant\u000aThe number of significant figures of a multiplication or division of two or more quantities is equal to the smallest number of significant figures for the quantities involved. For addition or subtraction, the number of significant figures is determined with the smallest significant figure of all the quantities involved. For example, the sum 10.234 + 5.2 + 100.323 is 115.7574, but should be written 115.8 (with rounding), since the quantity 5.2 is significant only to ± 0.1.
p1715
aVTwo figures are said to be similar when all corresponding angles are equal and all distances are increased (or decreased) in the same ratio, called the ratio of magnification. A transformation that takes figures to similar figures is called a similarity.\u000aTwo figures are directly similar when all corresponding angles are equal and described in the same rotational sense. This relationship is written A~B. (The symbol ~ is also used to mean "is the same order of magnitude as" and "is asymptotic to.") Two figures are inversely similar when all corresponding angles are equal and described in the opposite rotational sense.

aVA continued fraction \u03be is said to be regular if it has the form\u000a\u03be = b_0 + 1/(b_1 + 1/(b_2 + 1/\u22f1)), where b_k element Z for all k = 0, 1, 2, ... and where b_k>0 for k>=1. The regular fraction \u03be above can also be written \u03be = [b_0 ;b_1, b_2, ...] or, using Gauss notation, \u03be = b_0 + continued fraction k _(m=1)^\u221e 1/b_m.\u000aThe terms b_k are said to be both the partial quotients and the partial denominators of \u03be, as the partial numerators of \u03be are all identically 1.\u000aIt is not uncommon in literature for the unmodified term "continued fraction" to mean "regular continued fraction, " and despite an apparent loss of generality in doing so, no such loss exists. Indeed, a well-known result in the study of continued fractions is the existence of an equivalence transformation r = {r_m} between any generalized continued fraction \u03be and an associated regular continued fraction \u03be_reg, whereby it follows that any theory for generalized continued fractions holds for regular fractions and vice versa. Regular continued fractions are especially useful when representing irrationals, for example, because the convergents of regular continued fractions are the so-called best rational approximations thereof.

aVA simple group is a group whose only normal subgroups are the trivial subgroup of order one and the improper subgroup consisting of the entire original group. Simple groups include the infinite families of alternating groups of degree >=5, cyclic groups of prime order, Lie-type groups, and the 26 sporadic groups.

aVSimple harmonic motion refers to the periodic sinusoidal oscillation of an object or quantity. Simple harmonic motion is executed by any quantity obeying the differential equation\u000ax^¨ + \u03c9_0^2 x = 0, where x^¨ denotes the second derivative of x with respect to t, and \u03c9_0 is the angular frequency of oscillation. This ordinary differential equation has an irregular singularity at \u221e.

aVThe simplex method is a method for solving problems in linear programming. This method, invented by George Dantzig in 1947, tests adjacent vertices of the feasible set (which is a polytope) in sequence so that at each new vertex the objective function improves or is unchanged. The simplex method is very efficient in practice, generally taking 2m to 3m iterations at most (where m is the number of equality constraints), and converging in expected polynomial time for certain distributions of random inputs (Nocedal and Wright 1999, Forsgren 2002). However, its worst-case complexity is exponential, as can be demonstrated with carefully constructed examples.

aVLet the values of a function f(x) be tabulated at points x_i equally spaced by h = x_(i + 1) - x_i, so f_1 = f(x_1), f_2 = f(x_2), ..., f_4 = f(x_4). Then Simpson's 3/8 rule approximating the integral of f(x) is given by the Newton-Cotes-like formula\u000a integral_(x_1)^(x_4) f(x) dx = 3/8 h(f_1 + 3f_2 + 3f_3 + f_4) - 3/80 h^5 f^(4)(\u03be).

aVSimpson's paradox, also known as the amalgamation paradox, reversal paradox, or Yule-Simpson effect, is a paradox in which a statistical trend appears to be present when data are segmented into separate groups of data but disappears (or reverses) when the data is considered as a whole. Simpson's paradox can arise when causal relations are ignored, but disappears when they are properly accounted for.

aVSimpson's rule is a Newton-Cotes formula for approximating the integral of a function f using quadratic polynomials. It can be written as integral_(x_0)^(x_2)f(x) dx\u2248h(f_0 + 4f_1 + f_2)/3.

aVThe Simson line is the line containing the feet P_1, P_2, and P_3 of the perpendiculars from an arbitrary point P on the circumcircle of a triangle to the sides or their extensions of the triangle. This line was attributed to Simson by Poncelet, but is now frequently known as the Wallace-Simson line since it does not actually appear in any work of Simson (Johnson 1929, p. 137, p. 41; de Guzmán 1999). The inverse statement to that given above, namely that the locus of all points P in the plane of a triangle \u0394ABC such that the feet of perpendiculars from the three sides of the triangle is collinear is given by the circumcircle of \u0394ABC, is sometimes called the Wallace-Simson theorem (de Guzmán 1999).

aVThe sinc function sinc(x), also called the "sampling function, " is a function that arises frequently in signal processing and the theory of Fourier transforms. The full name of the function is "sine cardinal, " but it is commonly referred to by its abbreviation, "sinc." There are two definitions in common use. The one adopted in this work defines\u000asinc(x) congruent {1 | for x = 0\u000a(sinx)/x | otherwise, auto right match \u000awhere sinx is the sine function, plotted above.

aVThe sine function sinx is one of the basic functions encountered in trigonometry (the others being the cosecant, cosine, cotangent, secant, and tangent). Let \u03b8 be an angle measured counterclockwise from the x-axis along an arc of the unit circle. Then sin\u03b8 is the vertical coordinate of the arc endpoint, as illustrated in the left figure above.\u000aThe common schoolbook definition of the sine of an angle \u03b8 in a right triangle (which is equivalent to the definition just given) is as the ratio of the lengths of the side of the triangle opposite the angle and the hypotenuse, i.e., sin\u03b8 = opposite/hypotenuse.

aVA partial differential equation which appears in differential geometry and relativistic field theory. Its name is a wordplay on its similar form to the Klein-Gordon equation. The equation, as well as several solution techniques, were known in the 19th century, but the equation grew greatly in importance when it was realized that it led to solutions ("kink" and "antikink") with the collisional properties of solitons. The sine-Gordon equation also appears in a number of other physical applications (Barone 1971; Gibbon et al. 1979; Davydov 1985, pp. 202 and 240), including the propagation of fluxons in Josephson junctions (a junction between two superconductors), the motion of rigid pendula attached to a stretched wire, and dislocations in crystals.

aVIn general, a singularity is a point at which an equation, surface, etc., blows up or becomes degenerate. Singularities are often also called singular points.\u000aSingularities are extremely important in complex analysis, where they characterize the possible behaviors of analytic functions. Complex singularities are points z_0 in the domain of a function f where f fails to be analytic. Isolated singularities may be classified as poles, essential singularities, logarithmic singularities, or removable singularities. Nonisolated singularities may arise as natural boundaries or branch cuts.\u000aConsider the second-order ordinary differential equation\u000ay'' + P(x) y' + Q(x) y = 0.
p1733
aVThere are two types of singular values, one in the context of elliptic integrals, and the other in linear algebra.\u000aFor a square matrix A, the square roots of the eigenvalues of A^H A, where A^H is the conjugate transpose, are called singular values. The so-called singular value decomposition of a complex matrix A is given by\u000aA = UDV^H, where U and V are unitary matrices and D is a diagonal matrix whose elements are the singular values of A (Golub and Van Loan 1996, pp. 70 and 73). Singular values are returned by the command SingularValueList[m].

aVAn SIR model is an epidemiological model that computes the theoretical number of people infected with a contagious illness in a closed population over time. The name of this class of models derives from the fact that they involve coupled equations relating the number of susceptible people S(t), number of people infected I(t), and number of people who have recovered R(t). One of the simplest SIR models is the Kermack-McKendrick model.\u000aThe Season 1 episode "Vector" of the television crime drama NUMB3RS features SIR models.

aVTwo or more lines which have no intersections but are not parallel, also called agonic lines. Since two lines in the plane must intersect or be parallel, skew lines can exist only in three or more dimensions.\u000aTwo lines with equations\u000ax | = | x_1 + (x_2 - x_1) s\u000ax | = | x_3 + (x_4 - x_3) t\u000aare skew if\u000a(x_1 - x_3)·[(x_2 - x_1)x(x_4 - x_3)]!=0\u000a.

aVSkewness is a measure of the degree of asymmetry of a distribution. If the left tail (tail at small end of the distribution) is more pronounced than the right tail (tail at the large end of the distribution), the function is said to have negative skewness. If the reverse is true, it has positive skewness. If the two are equal, it has zero skewness.\u000aSeveral types of skewness are defined, the terminology and notation of which are unfortunately rather confusing.

aVA formula of first-order logic is said to be in Skolemized form (sometimes also called Skolem standard form or universal form) if it is of the form\u000a for all x_1 ... for all x_n M, where M is a quantifier-free formula in conjunctive normal form known as the matrix of the formula in question. Since M is a conjunction of clauses each of which is a disjunction of literals, M is often viewed as a set of the clauses. The process of placing a formula in Skolemized form is known as Skolemization.

aVA mechanical device consisting of a sliding portion and a fixed case, each marked with logarithmic axes. By lining up the ticks, it is possible to do multiplication by taking advantage of the additive property of logarithms. More complicated slide rules also allow the extraction of roots and computation of trigonometric functions.\u000aAccording to Steinhaus, the principle of the slide rule was first enumerated by E. Gunter in 1623, and in 1671, S. Partridge constructed an instrument similar to the modern slide rule. The Oughtred Society, a group of slide rule collectors, claims that W. Oughtred invented the first slide rule in 1622.

For a line in the xy-plane making an angle \u03b8 with the x-axis, the slope m is a constant given by\u000am congruent (\u0394y)/(\u0394x) = tan\u03b8, where \u0394x and \u0394y are changes in the two coordinates over some distance.

aVGiven an ordinary differential equation y' = f(x, y), the slope field for that differential equation is the vector field that takes a point (x, y) to a unit vector with slope f(x, y). The vectors in a slope field are usually drawn without arrowheads, indicating that they can be followed in either direction. Using a visualization of a slope field, it is easy to graphically trace out solution curves to initial value problems. For example, the illustration above shows the slope field for the equation f(x, y) = x + y together with solution curves for various initial values of (x, y).

aVThe small rhombicuboctahedron is the 26-faced Archimedean solid A_6 consisting of faces 8{3} + 18{4}. Although this solid is sometimes also called the truncated icosidodecahedron, this name is inappropriate since true truncation would yield rectangular instead of square faces. It is uniform polyhedron U_10 and Wenninger model W_13. It has Schläfli symbol r{3\u000a4} and Wythoff symbol 34|2.\u000aThe solid may also be called an expanded (or cantellated) cube or octahedron since it may be constructed from either of these solids by the process of expansion.

aVTaking a connected graph or network with a high graph diameter and adding a very small number of edges randomly, the diameter tends to drop drastically. This is known as the small world phenomenon.

aVA smooth function is a function that has continuous derivatives up to some desired order over some domain. A function can therefore be said to be smooth over a restricted interval such as (a, b) or [a, b]. The number of continuous derivatives necessary for a function to be considered smooth depends on the problem at hand, and may vary from two to infinity. A function for which all orders of derivatives are continuous is called a C^\u221e-function.

aVThe theory of analyzing a decision between a collection of alternatives made by a collection of n voters with separate opinions. Any choice for the entire group should reflect the desires of the individual voters to the extent possible.\u000aFair choice procedures usually satisfy anonymity (invariance under permutation of voters), duality (each alternative receives equal weight for a single vote), and monotonicity (a change favorable for X does not hurt X). Simple majority vote is anonymous, dual, and monotone. May's theorem states a stronger result.

In three dimensions, there are three periodic packings for identical spheres: cubic lattice, face-centered cubic lattice, and hexagonal lattice. It was hypothesized by Kepler in 1611 that close packing (cubic or hexagonal, which have equivalent packing densities) is the densest possible, and this assertion is known as the Kepler conjecture. The problem of finding the densest packing of spheres (not necessarily periodic) is therefore known as the Kepler problem, where\u000a\u03b7_Kepler = \u03b7_(CCP) = \u03b7_(HCP) = \u03c0/(3sqrt(2))\u224874.048%

In spherical geometry, straight lines are great circles, so any two lines meet in two points. There are also no parallel lines. The angle between two lines in spherical geometry is the angle between the planes of the corresponding great circles, and a spherical triangle is defined by its three angles.

aVThe spherical harmonics Y_l^m(\u03b8, \u03d5) are the angular portion of the solution to Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates where azimuthal symmetry is not present. Some care must be taken in identifying the notational convention being used. In this entry, \u03b8 is taken as the polar (colatitudinal) coordinate with \u03b8 element [0, \u03c0], and \u03d5 as the azimuthal (longitudinal) coordinate with \u03d5 element [0, 2\u03c0). This is the convention normally used in physics, as described by Arfken and the Wolfram Language (in mathematical literature, \u03b8 usually denotes the longitudinal coordinate and \u03d5 the colatitudinal coordinate). Spherical harmonics are implemented in the Wolfram Language as SphericalHarmonicY[l, m, theta, phi].\u000aSpherical harmonics satisfy the spherical harmonic differential equation, which is given by the angular part of Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates. Writing F = \u03a6(\u03d5) \u0398(\u03b8) in this equation gives\u000a(\u03a6(\u03d5))/(sin\u03b8) d/(d\u03b8)(sin\u03b8(d\u0398)/(d\u03b8)) + (\u0398(\u03b8))/(sin^2 \u03b8)(d^2 \u03a6(\u03d5))/(d\u03d5^2) + l(l + 1) \u0398(\u03b8) \u03a6(\u03d5) = 0.\u000aMultiplying by sin^2 \u03b8/(\u0398\u03a6) gives\u000a[(sin\u03b8)/(\u0398(\u03b8)) d/(d\u03b8)(sin\u03b8(d\u0398)/(d\u03b8)) + l(l + 1) sin^2 \u03b8] + 1/(\u03a6(\u03d5))(d^2 \u03a6(\u03d5))/(d\u03d5^2) = 0.\u000aUsing separation of variables by equating the \u03d5-dependent portion to a constant gives\u000a1/(\u03a6(\u03d5))(d^2 \u03a6(\u03d5))/(d\u03d5^2) = - m^2, which has solutions\u000a\u03a6(\u03d5) = Ae^(-im\u03d5) + Be^(im\u03d5) .\u000aPlugging in (-2) into (-3) gives the equation for the \u03b8-dependent portion, whose solution is\u000a\u0398(\u03b8) = P_l^m(cos\u03b8), where m = - l, -(l - 1), ..., 0, ..., l - 1, l and P_l^m(z) is an associated Legendre polynomial. The spherical harmonics are then defined by combining \u03a6(\u03d5) and \u0398(\u03b8), Y_l^m(\u03b8, \u03d5) congruent sqrt((2l + 1)/(4\u03c0)((l - m)!)/((l + m)!))

Here, z^_ denotes the complex conjugate and \u03b4_(mn) is the Kronecker delta. Sometimes, the Condon-Shortley phase (-1)^m is prepended to the definition of the spherical harmonics.\u000aThe spherical harmonics are sometimes separated into their real and imaginary parts, Y_l^m^s(\u03b8, \u03d5) congruent sqrt((2l + 1)/(4\u03c0)((l - m)!)/((l + m)!))

aV"Spikey" is the logo of Wolfram Research, makers of Mathematica and the Wolfram Language. In its original (Version 1) form, it is a cumulated icosahedron with a cumulation ratio of sqrt(6)/3, not to be confused with the great stellated dodecahedron, which is a distinct solid. This gives it 60 equilateral triangular faces, making it a deltahedron. More elaborate forms of spikey have been used for subsequent versions of Mathematica. In particular, spikeys for version 2 and up are based on a hyperbolic dodecahedron with embellishments rather than a cumulated icosahedron.

If the resulting set of marriages contains no pairs of the form {m_i, w_j}, {m_k, w_l} such that m_i prefers w_l to w_j and w_l prefers m_i to m_k, the marriage is said to be stable. Gale and Shapley showed that a stable marriage exists for any choice of rankings. In the United States, the algorithm of Gale and Shapley is used to match hospitals to medical interns.

aVThe number of ways of folding a strip of stamps has several possible variants. Considering only positions of the hinges for unlabeled stamps without regard to orientation of the stamps, the number of foldings is denoted U(n). If the stamps are labeled and orientation is taken into account, the number of foldings is denoted N(n). Finally, the number of symmetric foldings is denoted S(n). The following table summarizes these values for the first n.

aVA standard basis, also called a natural basis, is a special orthonormal vector basis in which each basis vector has a single nonzero entry with value 1. In n-dimensional Euclidean space R^n, the vectors are usually denoted e_i (or e^\u21c0_i) with i = 1, ..., n, where n is the dimension of the vector space that is spanned by this basis according to\u000a(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) = x_1 e_1 + x_2 e_2 + ... + x_n e_n .\u000aFor example, in the Euclidean plane R^2, the standard basis is\u000ae_1 | = | e_x = (1, 0)\u000ae_2 | = | e_y = (0, 1).

aVThe standard deviation \u03c3 of a probability distribution is defined as the square root of the variance \u03c3^2, \u03c3 | = | sqrt(\u2329x^2 \u232a - (\u2329x\u232a)^2)\u000a | = | sqrt(\u03bc_2^, - \u03bc^2), where \u03bc = x^_ = \u2329x\u232a is the mean, \u03bc_2^, = \u2329x^2 \u232a is the second raw moment, and \u2329x\u232a denotes the expectation value of x.

aVThere appear to be two different definitions of the standard error.\u000aThe standard error of a sample of sample size n is the sample's standard deviation divided by sqrt(n). It therefore estimates the standard deviation of the sample mean based on the population mean . Note that while this definition makes no reference to a normal distribution, many uses of this quantity implicitly assume such a distribution.

aVA two-dimensional map also called the Taylor-Greene-Chirikov map in some of the older literature and defined by\u000aI_(n + 1) | = | I_n + Ksin\u03b8_n\u000a\u03b8_(n + 1) | = | \u03b8_n + I_(n + 1)\u000a | = | I_n + \u03b8_n + Ksin\u03b8_n, where I and \u03b8 are computed mod 2\u03c0 and K is a positive constant.

If no specification is made, "torus" is taken to mean ring torus.

aVA state diagram is a labeled directed graph together with state information that can be used to indicate that certain paths on in a system may be traversed only in a certain way. State diagrams are also known as problem space models (Atallah 1998, p. 36-2). For example, in the left figure above (due to R. Abbott), a car must traverse a town while obeying all traffic laws, and making no U-turns. Initially, the car is at position 4, travelling east, and has a choice of moving to position 1, travelling east, or position 5, travelling east. The State diagram corresponding to the maze is illustrated in the above right figure.

aVGiven two circles with one interior to the other, if small tangent circles can be inscribed around the region between the two circles such that the final circle is tangent to the first, the circles form a Steiner chain.\u000aThe simplest way to construct a Steiner chain is to perform an inversion on a symmetrical arrangement on n circles packed between a central circle of radius b and an outer concentric circle of radius a.
p1817
aVA Steiner quadruple system is a Steiner system S(t = 3, k = 4, v), where S is a v-set and B is a collection of k-sets of S such that every t-subset of S is contained in exactly one member of B. Barrau established the uniqueness of S(3, 4, 8),
p1818
aVIf a Steiner chain is formed from one starting circle, then a Steiner chain is formed from any other starting circle. In other words, given two circles with one interior to the other, draw circles successively touching them and each other. If the last touches the first, this will also happen for any position of the first circle.
p1819
aVA projection of the Veronese surface into three dimensions (which must contain singularities) is called a Steiner surface. A classification of Steiner surfaces allowing complex parameters and projective transformations was accomplished in the 19th century. The surfaces obtained by restricting to real parameters and transformations were classified into 10 types by Coffman et al. (1996). Examples of Steiner surfaces include the Roman surface (sometimes know as "the" Steiner surface; Coffman type 1) and cross-cap (type 3).
p1820
aVA Steiner system S(t, k, v) is a set X of v points, and a collection of subsets of X of size k (called blocks), such that any t points of X are in exactly one of the blocks. The special case t = 2 and k = 3 corresponds to a so-called Steiner triple system. For a projective plane, v = n^2 + n + 1, k = n + 1, t = 2, and the blocks are simply lines.\u000aThe number r of blocks containing a point in a S(t, k, v) Steiner system is independent of the point.
p1821
aVLet X be a set of v>=3 elements together with a set B of 3-subset (triples) of X such that every 2-subset of X occurs in exactly one triple of B. Then B is called a Steiner triple system and is a special case of a Steiner system with t = 2 and k = 3. A Steiner triple system S(v) = S(v, k = 3, \u03bb = 1) of order v exists iff v congruent 1, 3 (mod 6). In addition, if Steiner triple systems S_1 and S_2 of orders v_1 and v_2 exist, then so does a Steiner triple system S of order v_1 v_2.

aVThe solid common to two (or three) right circular cylinders of equal radii intersecting at right angles is called the Steinmetz solid. Two cylinders intersecting at right angles are called a bicylinder or mouhefanggai (Chinese for "two square umbrellas"), and three intersecting cylinders a tricylinder. Half of a bicylinder is called a vault.

aVThe stella octangula is a polyhedron compound composed of a tetrahedron and its dual (a second tetrahedron rotated 180° with respect to the first). The stella octangula is also (incorrectly) called the stellated tetrahedron, and is the only stellation of the octahedron. A wireframe version of the stella octangula is sometimes known as the merkaba and imbued with mystic properties.\u000aThe name "stella octangula" is due to Kepler, but the solid was known earlier to many others, including Pacioli, who called it the "octaedron elevatum, " and Jamnitzer; see Cromwell (1997, pp. 124 and 152).\u000aIt is implemented in the Wolfram Language as PolyhedronData[StellaOctangula].
p1824
aVStellation is the process of constructing polyhedra by extending the facial planes past the polyhedron edges of a given polyhedron until they intersect. The set of all possible polyhedron edges of the stellations can be obtained by finding all intersections on the facial planes. Since the number and variety of intersections can become unmanageable for complicated polyhedra, additional rules are sometimes added to constrain allowable stellations. There exists a Wolfram Language function Stellate[poly, ratio] in the Wolfram Language package PolyhedronOperations \u0300 , although it actually replaces faces with pyramids (i.e., performs what is properly known as cumulation), and therefore does not perform true stellation.
p1825
aVA stem-and-leaf diagram, also called a stem-and-leaf plot, is a diagram that quickly summarizes data while maintaining the individual data points. In such a diagram, the "stem" is a column of the unique elements of data after removing the last digit. The final digits ("leaves") of each column are then placed in a row next to the appropriate column and sorted in numerical order. This diagram was invented by John Tukey.

aVA function on the reals R is a step function if it can be written as a finite linear combination of semi-open intervals [a, b)\u2286R. Therefore, a step function f can be written as\u000af(x) = \u03b1_1 f_1(x) + ... + \u03b1_n f_n(x), where \u03b1_i element R, f_i(x) = 1 if x element [a_i, b_i) and 0 otherwise, for i = 1, ..., n.

aVA plane image or pair of two-dimensional images that, when appropriately viewed using both eyes, produces an image which appears to be three-dimensional. By taking a pair of photographs from slightly different angles and then allowing one eye to view each image, a stereogram is not difficult to produce.\u000aAmazingly, it turns out that the three-dimensional effect can be produced by both eyes looking at a single image by defocusing the eyes at a certain distance. Such stereograms are called "random-dot stereograms."

aVA map projection obtained by projecting points P on the surface of sphere from the sphere's north pole N to point P' in a plane tangent to the south pole S. In such a projection, great circles are mapped to circles, and loxodromes become logarithmic spirals.\u000aStereographic projections have a very simple algebraic form that results immediately from similarity of triangles. In the above figures, let the stereographic sphere have radius r, and the z-axis positioned as shown. Then a variety of different transformation formulas are possible depending on the relative positions of the projection plane and z-axis.

aVLet a Cevian PC be drawn on a triangle \u0394ABC, and denote the lengths m = (PA)^_ and n = (PB)^_, with c = m + n. Then Stewart's theorem, also called Apollonius' theorem, states that\u000ama^2 + nb^2 = (m + n)((PC)^_)^2 + mn^2 + nm^2 .\u000aIn particular, if k is the fraction of the distance of P from vertex A to vertex B and k' = 1 - k, then m = kc, n = k' c, and\u000a((PC)^_)^2 = a^2 k - (c^2 k - b^2) k', giving the above identity.

aVA stochastic matrix, also called a probability matrix, probability transition matrix, transition matrix, substitution matrix, or Markov matrix, is matrix used to characterize transitions for a finite Markov chain, Elements of the matrix must be real numbers in the closed interval [0, 1].\u000aA completely independent type of stochastic matrix is defined as a square matrix with entries in a field F such that the sum of elements in each column equals 1. There are two nonsingular 2×2 stochastic matrices over Z_2 (i.e., the integers mod 2), [1 | 0\u000a0 | 1] and [0 | 1\u000a1 | 0].

aVStochastic optimization refers to the minimization (or maximization) of a function in the presence of randomness in the optimization process. The randomness may be present as either noise in measurements or Monte Carlo randomness in the search procedure, or both.\u000aCommon methods of stochastic optimization include direct search methods (such as the Nelder-Mead method), stochastic approximation, stochastic programming, and miscellaneous methods such as simulated annealing and genetic algorithms.

aVDoob defines a stochastic process as a family of random variables {x(t, \u2022), t element J} from some probability space (S, S, P) into a state space (S', S'). Here, J is the index set of the process.\u000aPapoulis describes a stochastic process x(t) as a family of functions.

aVA stochastic resonance is a phenomenon in which a nonlinear system is subjected to a periodic modulated signal so weak as to be normally undetectable, but it becomes detectable due to resonance between the weak deterministic signal and stochastic noise. The earliest definition of stochastic resonance was the maximum of the output signal strength as a function of noise.

aVThe stomachion is a 14-piece dissection puzzle similar to tangrams. It is described in fragmentary manuscripts attributed to Archimedes as noted by Magnus Ausonius (310-395 A.D.). The puzzle is also referred to as the "loculus of Archimedes" (Archimedes' box) or "syntemachion" in Latin texts. The word stomachion has as its root the Greek word \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1^' \u03c7\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, meaning "stomach."

aVA string of length n on an alphabet l of m characters is an arrangement of n not necessarily distinct symbols from l. There are m^n such distinct strings.\u000aFor example, the strings of length n = 3 on the alphabet {1, 2} are {1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 2}, {1, 2, 1}, {1, 2, 2}, {2, 1, 1}, {2, 1, 2}, {2, 2, 1}, and {2, 2, 2}.\u000aIn the Wolfram Language, strings of length n in the alphabet consisting of the members of a list l can be enumerated using Tuples[list, n].

aVA substitution system in which rules are used to operate on a string consisting of letters of a certain alphabet. String rewriting systems are also variously known as rewriting systems, reduction systems, or term rewriting systems.

The solutions (with appropriate boundary conditions) of \u03bb are called eigenvalues and the corresponding u_\u03bb(x) eigenfunctions. The solutions of this equation satisfy important mathematical properties under appropriate boundary conditions.

aVA subgroup is a subset H of group elements of a group G that satisfies the four group requirements. It must therefore contain the identity element. "H is a subgroup of G" is written H\u2286G, or sometimes H<=G.\u000aThe order of any subgroup of a group of order h must be a divisor of h.\u000aA subgroup H of a group G that does not include the entire group G itself is known as a proper subgroup, denoted H subset G or H<G.

aVA k-subset is a subset of a set on n elements containing exactly k elements. The number of k-subsets on n elements is therefore given by the binomial coefficient (n\u000ak). For example, there are (3\u000a2) = 3 2-subsets of {1, 2, 3}, namely {1, 2}, {1, 3}, and {2, 3}.\u000aThe k-subsets of a list can be enumerated in the Wolfram Language as Subsets[list, {k}].

aVA map which uses a set of rules to transform elements of a sequence into a new sequence using a set of rules which "translate" from the original sequence to its transformation. For example, the substitution system {1->0, 0->11} would take 10->11->1100->1111->11110000->....

aVSubtraction is the operation of taking the difference d = x - y of two numbers x and y. Here, x is called the minuend, y is called the subtrahend, and the symbol between the x and y is called the minus sign. The expression "x - y" is read "x minus y."\u000aSubtraction is the inverse of addition, so x + y - y = x - y + y = x.\u000aThe subtraction of a number from itself gives 0, while the subtraction of a real number from a smaller real number gives a negative real number. Subtraction of real numbers can be naturally extended to complex numbers.

aVA sum is the result of an addition. For example, adding 1, 2, 3, and 4 gives the sum 10, written\u000a1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.\u000aThe numbers being summed are called addends, or sometimes summands. The summation operation can also be indicated using a capital sigma with upper and lower limits written above and below, and the index indicated below. For example, the above sum could be written\u000a sum_(k = 1)^4 k = 10.\u000aThe sum of a list of numbers is implemented as Total[list].

Then sopfr(n) for n = 1, 2, ... is given by 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7, 6, 6, 7, 11, 7, 13, 9, 8, ... (OEIS A001414). The sum of prime factors function is also known as the integer logarithm.\u000aThe high-water marks are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ..., which occur at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ... (OEIS A046022), which, with the exception of the first term, correspond exactly to the actual values of the high-water marks.

aVThe number of representations of n by k squares, allowing zeros and distinguishing signs and order, is denoted r_k(n). The special case k = 2 corresponding to two squares is often denoted simply r_2(n) = r(n) (e.g., Hardy and Wright 1979, p. 241; Shanks 1993, p. 162).

aVA superellipse is a curve with Cartesian equation\u000a( left bracketing bar x/a right bracketing bar )^r + ( left bracketing bar y/b right bracketing bar )^r = 1, first discussed in 1818 by Lamé. A superellipse may be described parametrically by\u000ax | = | acos^(2/r) t\u000ay | = | bsin^(2/r) t.\u000aThe restriction to r>2 is sometimes made.

aVThe superellipsoid is a generalization of the ellipsoid.\u000aThe version also called the superquadratic ellipsoid is defined by the equation\u000a(( left bracketing bar x right bracketing bar )^(2/e) + ( left bracketing bar y right bracketing bar )^(2/e))^(e/n) + ( left bracketing bar z right bracketing bar )^(2/n) = 1, where e and n are the east-west and north-south exponents, respectively. The superellipsoid can be rendered in POVRay® with the command\u000a superellipsoid{ <e, n> }

aVThe supremum is the least upper bound of a set S, defined as a quantity M such that no member of the set exceeds M, but if \u03f5 is any positive quantity, however small, there is a member that exceeds M - \u03f5. When it exists (which is not required by this definition, e.g., supR does not exist), it is denoted sup_(x element S) x (or sometimes simply sup_S for short). The supremum is implemented in the Wolfram Language as MaxValue[f, constr, vars].

aVSurface area is the area of a given surface. Roughly speaking, it is the "amount" of a surface (i.e., it is proportional to the amount of paint needed to cover it), and has units of distance squared. Surface area is commonly denoted S for a surface in three dimensions, or A for a region of the plane (in which case it is simply called "the" area).

aVA surface of revolution is a surface generated by rotating a two-dimensional curve about an axis. The resulting surface therefore always has azimuthal symmetry. Examples of surfaces of revolution include the apple, cone (excluding the base), conical frustum (excluding the ends), cylinder (excluding the ends), Darwin-de Sitter spheroid, Gabriel's horn, hyperboloid, lemon, oblate spheroid, paraboloid, prolate spheroid, pseudosphere, sphere, spheroid, and torus (and its generalization, the toroid).

aVLet f be a function defined on a set A and taking values in a set B. Then f is said to be a surjection (or surjective map) if, for any b element B, there exists an a element A for which b = f(a). A surjection is sometimes referred to as being "onto."\u000aLet the function be an operator which maps points in the domain to every point in the range and let V be a vector space with A, B element V. Then a transformation T defined on V is a surjection if there is an A element V such that T(A) = B for all B.\u000aIn the categories of sets, groups, modules, etc., an epimorphism is the same as a surjection, and is used synonymously with "surjection" outside of category theory.

aVThe point of concurrence K of the symmedians, sometimes also called the Lemoine point (in England and France) or the Grebe point (in Germany). Equivalently, the symmedian point is the isogonal conjugate of the triangle centroid G. In other words, let G be the triangle centroid of a triangle \u0394ABC, AM_A, BM_B, and CM_C the medians of \u0394ABC, AL_A, BL_B, and CL_C the angle bisectors of angles A, B, C, and AK_A, BK_B, and CK_C the reflections of AM_A, BM_B, and CM_C about AL_A, BL_B, and CL_C. Then K is the point of concurrence of the lines AK_A, BK_B, and CK_C. According to Honsberger, the symmedian point is "one of the crown jewels of modern geometry." The symmedian point is Kimberling center X_6.\u000aThe symmedian point has equivalent triangle center functions and\u000a\u03b1_6 = a\u000a(Honsberger 1995, p. 75), or\u000a\u03b1_6 = sinA.\u000aIn exact trilinear coordinates, the symmedian point is the point for which \u03b1^2 + \u03b2^2 + \u03b3^2 is a minimum. A center X is the triangle centroid of its own pedal triangle iff it is the symmedian point. The symmedian point is the perspectivity center of a triangle and its tangential triangle.\u000aThe following table summarizes the symmedian points for named triangles that are Kimberling centers.\u000atriangle | Kimberling | symmedian point of given triangle\u000aanticomplementary triangle | X_69 | symmedian point of the anticomplementary triangle\u000acircumcircle mid-arc triangle | X_1001 | midpoint of X_1 and X_9\u000acircum-medial triangle | X_183 | trilinear quotient X_75/X_98\u000acircumnormal triangle | X_3 | circumcenter\u000acircumtangential triangle | X_3 | circumcenter\u000acontact triangle | X_7 | Gergonne point\u000aD-triangle | X_6 | symmedian point\u000aexcentral triangle | X_9 | mittenpunkt\u000afirst Morley triangle | X_356 | first Morley center\u000afirst Yff circles triangle | X_611 | intersection of lines X_1 X_6 and X_55 X_511\u000ainner Napoleon triangle | X_2 | triangle centroid\u000amedial triangle | X_141 | complement of symmedian point\u000aorthic triangle | X_53 | symmedian point of orthic triangle\u000aouter Napoleon triangle | X_2 | triangle centroid\u000areference triangle | X_6 | symmedian point\u000asecond Yff circles triangle | X_613 | intersection of lines X_1 X_6 and X_56 X_511\u000aStammler triangle | X_3 | circumcenter\u000atangential triangle | X_157 | symmedian point of the tangential triangle\u000asecond Brocard triangle | X_574 | harmonic of X_187\u000aIn the above diagram with K the symmedian point, (AK)/(KK_A) = (b^2 + c^2)/a^2\u000a(Honsberger 1995, p. 76).\u000aThe symmedian point lies on the Brocard axis and the Fermat axis. It lies of the Brocard circle and is the center of the cosine circle. It also lies on the Jerabek hyperbola and the Thomson cubic.\u000aIts distances from K to the sides of the triangle are\u000aKK_i = 1/2 a_i tan\u03c9, where \u03c9 is the Brocard angle.\u000aDistances to some other named triangle centers are given by\u000aKG | = | 1/(3(a^2 + b^2 + c^2))( sqrt(-a^6 + 3b^2 a^4 + 3c^2 a^4 + 3b^4 a^2 + 3c^4 a^2 - 15b^2 c^2 a^2 - b^6 - c^6 + 3b^2 c^4 + 3b^4 c^2))\u000aKH | = | 1/(4\u0394(a^2 + b^2 + c^2))( sqrt(a^10 - b^2 a^8 - c^2 a^8 + b^2 c^2 a^6 - b^8 a^2 - c^8 a^2 + b^2 c^6 a^2 + b^6 c^2 a^2 + b^10 + c^10 - b^2 c^8 - b^8 c^2))\u000aKI | = | 1/(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) sqrt(-1/(a + b + c)(abc(a^4 - 2ba^3 - 2ca^3 + 2b^2 a^2 + 2c^2 a^2 + bca^2 - 2b^3 a - 2c^3 a + bc^2 a + b^2 ca + b^4 + c^4 - 2bc^3 + 2b^2 c^2 - 2b^3 c)))\u000aKM | = | ((a + b + c)^2 IK)/(a^2 - 2ab + b^2 - asc - 2bc + c^2)\u000aKO | = | (2abc(a^4 - b^2 a^2 - c^2 a^2 + b^4 + c^4 - b^2 c^2))/(4\u0394(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)), where G is the triangle centroid, H is the orthocenter, I is the incenter, M is the mittenpunkt, and O is the circumcenter.\u000aOne Brocard line, triangle median, and symmedian (out of the three of each) are concurrent, with A\u03a9, CK, and BG meeting at a point, where \u03a9 is the first Brocard point and G is the triangle centroid. Similarly, A\u03a9', BG, and CK, where \u03a9' is the second Brocard point, meet at a point which is the isogonal conjugate of the first.\u000aThe line joining the midpoint of any side to the midpoint of the altitude on that side passes through K. In particular, the symmedian point of a right triangle is the midpoint of the altitude to the hypotenuse (right figure; Honsberger 1995, p. 59). The symmedian point K is the Steiner point of the first Brocard triangle.\u000aGiven a triangle \u0394ABC, construct the triangle \u0394A' B' C' obtained as the intersection of the lines extended from each vertex though the symmedian point K of \u0394ABC with the circumcircle of \u0394ABC. Then the symmedian point of \u0394A' B' C' is again K.\u000aThe tangents to the circumcircle of a triangle at two of its vertices meet on the symmedian from the third vertex. The Gergonne point of a triangle is the symmedian point of its contact triangle. The symmedian point of a triangle is the triangle centroid of its pedal triangle. And finally, the lengths of the sides of the pedal triangle of the symmedian point are proportional to the lengths of the triangle medians of the original triangle.

aVA mathematical object is said to be symmetric if it is invariant ("looks the same") under a symmetry transformation.\u000aA function, matrix, etc., is symmetric if it remains unchanged in sign when indices are reversed. For example, A_(ij) congruent a_i + a_j is symmetric since A_(ij) = A_(ji).
p1866
aVThe symmetric group S_n of degree n is the group of all permutations on n symbols. S_n is therefore a permutation group of order n! and contains as subgroups every group of order n.\u000aThe nth symmetric group is represented in the Wolfram Language as SymmetricGroup[n]. Its cycle index can be generated in the Wolfram Language using CycleIndexPolynomial[SymmetricGroup[n], {x1, ..., xn}]. \u000aThe number of conjugacy classes of S_n is given P(n), where P is the partition function P of n. The symmetric group is a transitive group.

aVAn intrinsic property of a mathematical object which causes it to remain invariant under certain classes of transformations (such as rotation, reflection, inversion, or more abstract operations). The mathematical study of symmetry is systematized and formalized in the extremely powerful and beautiful area of mathematics called group theory.\u000aSymmetry can be present in the form of coefficients of equations as well as in the physical arrangement of objects. By classifying the symmetry of polynomial equations using the machinery of group theory, for example, it is possible to prove the unsolvability of the general quintic equation.

aVSymmetry operations include the improper rotation, inversion operation, mirror plane, and rotation. Together, these operations create 32 crystal classes corresponding to the 32 point groups.\u000aThe inversion operation takes\u000a(x, y, z)->(-x, - y, - z)\u000aand is denoted i. When used in conjunction with a rotation, it becomes an improper rotation. An improper rotation by 360°/n is denoted n^_ (or S_n). For periodic crystals, the crystallography restriction allows only the improper rotations 1^_, 2^_, 3^_, 4^_, and 6^_.

aVSynthetic division is a shortcut method for dividing two polynomials which can be used in place of the standard long division algorithm. This method reduces the dividend and divisor polynomials into a set of numeric values. After these values are processed, the resulting set of numeric outputs is used to construct the polynomial quotient and the polynomial remainder.

aVA heptahedron which is topologically equivalent to a torus and for which every pair of faces has a polygon edge in common. The Szilassi polyhedron has 14 polyhedron vertices, seven faces, and 21 polyhedron edges, and is the dual polyhedron of the Császár polyhedron. This polyhedron was discovered by L. Szilassi in 1977. In the above illustration of the net, sides indicated by letters are connected with the corresponding side indicated by the same letter but with a different number of primes. Like the tetrahedron, each face of the Szilassi polyhedron touches all other faces.\u000aThe skeleton of the Szilassi polyhedron is equivalent to the Heawood graph, shown above.

aVA tag system is set of rules that specifies a fixed number of elements (commonly denoted \u03bd or \u03b2) be removed from the beginning of a sequence and a set of elements to be appended ("tagged" onto the end) based on the elements that were removed from the beginning. For example, consider the \u03bd = 1 tag system shown in the illustration above, in which black represents 1 and white represents 0. Then the starting pattern is "1" and the transition rules are (1, ...)->(..., 1, 0) and (0, ...)->(..., 0, 1).

aVThe tangent function is defined by\u000atanx congruent (sinx)/(cosx), where sinx is the sine function and cosx is the cosine function. The notation tgx is sometimes also used (Gradshteyn and Ryzhik 2000, p. xxix).\u000aThe common schoolbook definition of the tangent of an angle \u03b8 in a right triangle (which is equivalent to the definition just given) is as the ratio of the side lengths opposite to the angle and adjacent the angle, i.e., tan\u03b8 = opposite/adjacent.

aVTwo circles with centers at (x_i, y_i) with radii r_i for i = 1, 2 are mutually tangent if\u000a(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2 = (r_1 ± r_2)^2 .\u000aIf the center of the second circle is inside the first, then the - and + signs both correspond to internally tangent circles. If the center of the second circle is outside the first, then the - sign corresponds to externally tangent circles and the + sign to internally tangent circles.

aVThe tangential triangle is the triangle \u0394T_A T_B T_C formed by the lines tangent to the circumcircle of a given triangle \u0394ABC at its vertices. It is therefore antipedal triangle of \u0394ABC with respect to the circumcenter O. It is also anticevian triangle of \u0394ABC with the symmedian point K as the anticevian point. Furthermore, the symmedian point K of \u0394ABC is the Gergonne point of \u0394T_A T_B T_C.\u000aThe tangential triangle is the polar triangle of the circumcircle.

aVA straight line is tangent to a given curve f(x) at a point x_0 on the curve if the line passes through the point (x_0, f(x_0)) on the curve and has slope f'(x_0), where f'(x) is the derivative of f(x). This line is called a tangent line, or sometimes simply a tangent.

aVThe tangram is a combination of plane polygonal pieces such that the edges of the polygons are coincident. There are 13 convex tangrams (where a "convex tangram" is a set of tangram pieces arranged into a convex polygon).\u000aCuriously, a tangram with colored squares is part of the logo for the Dynegy company.

aVA function \u03c4(n) related to the divisor function \u03c3_k(n), also sometimes called Ramanujan's tau function. It is defined via the Fourier series of the modular discriminant \u0394(\u03c4) for \u03c4 element H, where H is the upper half-plane, by\u000a\u0394(\u03c4) = (2\u03c0)^12 sum_(n = 1)^\u221e \u03c4(n) e^(2\u03c0in\u03c4)\u000a(Apostol 1997, p. 20). The tau function is also given by the Cauchy product\u000a\u03c4(n) | = | 8000{(\u03c3_3 °\u03c3_3)°\u03c3_3}(n) - 147(\u03c3_5 °\u03c3_5)(n)\u000a | = | 65/756 \u03c3_11(n) + 691/756 \u03c3_5(n) - 691/3 sum_(k = 1)^(n - 1) \u03c3_5(k) \u03c3_5(n - k), where \u03c3_k(n) is the divisor function, \u03c3_3(0) = 1/240, and \u03c3_5(0) = - 1/504.

aVThe problem of finding the curve down which a bead placed anywhere will fall to the bottom in the same amount of time. The solution is a cycloid, a fact first discovered and published by Huygens in Horologium oscillatorium. This property was also alluded to in the following passage from Moby Dick: "[The try-pot] is also a place for profound mathematical meditation. It was in the left-hand try-pot of the Pequod, with the soapstone diligently circling round me, that I was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies gliding along a cycloid, my soapstone, for example, will descend from any point in precisely the same time".

aVA tautology is a logical statement in which the conclusion is equivalent to the premise. More colloquially, it is formula in propositional calculus which is always true.\u000aIf p is a tautology, it is written \u22a8p. A sentence whose truth table contains only 'T' is called a tautology.

aVThe taxicab metric, also called the Manhattan distance, is the metric of the Euclidean plane defined by\u000ag((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) = |x_1 - x_2 | + |y_1 - y_2 |, for all points P_1(x_1, y_1) and P_2(x_2, y_2). This number is equal to the length of all paths connecting P_1 and P_2 along horizontal and vertical segments, without ever going back, like those described by a car moving in a lattice-like street pattern.

aVFrom the feet H_A, H_B, and H_C of each altitude of a triangle \u0394ABC, draw lines (H_A P_A, H_A Q_A), (H_B P_B, H_B Q_B), (H_C P_C, H_C Q_C) perpendicular to the adjacent sides, as illustrated above. Then the points P_A, P_B, P_C, Q_A, Q_B, and Q_C are concyclic, and the circle passing through these points is called the Taylor circle. Here, P_A Q_A, P_B Q_B, and P_C Q_C are antiparallel to the sides BC, CA, and AB, respectively.\u000aFurthermore, the figures AH_C HH_B and AP_A H_A Q_A are similar, where H is the orthocenter of \u0394ABC, P_A Q_A is parallel to H_B H_C, and P_A Q_A bisects H_A H_B and H_A H_C.

aVA Taylor series is a series expansion of a function about a point. A one-dimensional Taylor series is an expansion of a real function f(x) about a point x = a is given by\u000af(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + (f''(a))/(2!)(x - a)^2 + (f^(3)(a))/(3!)(x - a)^3 + ... + (f^(n)(a))/(n!)(x - a)^n + .... \u000aIf a = 0, the expansion is known as a Maclaurin series.\u000aTaylor's theorem (actually discovered first by Gregory) states that any function satisfying certain conditions can be expressed as a Taylor series.

aVThe "temperature" of a curve \u0393 is defined as\u000aT congruent 1/(ln((2l)/(2l - h))), where l is the length of \u0393 and h is the length of the perimeter of the convex hull.

aVAn nth-rank tensor in m-dimensional space is a mathematical object that has n indices and m^n components and obeys certain transformation rules. Each index of a tensor ranges over the number of dimensions of space. However, the dimension of the space is largely irrelevant in most tensor equations (with the notable exception of the contracted Kronecker delta). Tensors are generalizations of scalars (that have no indices), vectors (that have exactly one index), and matrices (that have exactly two indices) to an arbitrary number of indices.\u000aTensors provide a natural and concise mathematical framework for formulating and solving problems in areas of physics such as elasticity, fluid mechanics, and general relativity.

aVThe base-3 method of counting in which only the digits 0, 1, and 2 are used. Ternary numbers arise in a number of problems in mathematics, including some problems of weighing. However, according to Knuth, "no substantial application of balanced ternary notation has been made" (balanced ternary uses digits -1, 0, and 1 instead of 0, 1, and 2).\u000aThe illustration above shows a graphical representation of the numbers 0 to 25 in ternary, and the following table gives the ternary equivalents of the first few decimal numbers. The concatenation of the ternary digits of the consecutive numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, ... gives (0), (1), (2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), ... (OEIS A054635).

aVA tiling of regular polygons (in two dimensions), polyhedra (three dimensions), or polytopes (n dimensions) is called a tessellation. Tessellations can be specified using a Schläfli symbol.\u000aThe breaking up of self-intersecting polygons into simple polygons is also called tessellation , or more properly, polygon tessellation.\u000aThere are exactly three regular tessellations composed of regular polygons symmetrically tiling the plane.

The figure above shows a projection of the tesseract in three-space. The tesseract is composed of 8 cubes with 3 to an edge, and therefore has 16 vertices, 32 edges, 24 squares, and 8 cubes. It is one of the six regular polychora.\u000aThe tesseract has 261 distinct nets (Gardner 1966, Turney 1984-85, Tougne 1986, Buekenhout and Parker 1998).

aVA tetractys, also called a tetraktys or decad, is an arrangement of 10 points in the form of a triangle with 1 point in the first row, two in the second, three in the third, and four in the fourth.

aVIn general, a tetrahedron is a polyhedron with four sides.\u000aIf all faces are congruent, the tetrahedron is known as an isosceles tetrahedron. If all faces are congruent to an equilateral triangle, then the tetrahedron is known as a regular tetrahedron (although the term "tetrahedron" without further qualification is often used to mean "regular tetrahedron"). A tetrahedron having a trihedron all of the face angles of which are right angles is known as a trirectangular tetrahedron.

aVA tetraview is a visualization technique for bivariate complex functions. In the simplest case, the graph of a complex-valued function w = w(z) can be considered as a hypersurface in R^4 with four real coordinates (\u211c[z], \u2111[z], \u211c[w(z)], \u2111[w(z)]). Carrying out a rotation in four dimensions and projecting the first three coordinates into (ordinary) R^3 then allows the changes from (\u211c[z], \u2111[z], \u211c[w(z)]) to (\u211c[z], \u2111[z], \u2111[w(z)]) to (\u211c[w(z)], \u2111[w(z)], \u211c[z]) to (\u211c[w(z)], \u2111[w(z)], \u2111[z]) to be visualized continuously.

aVAnalysis of data ordered by the time the data were collected (usually spaced at equal intervals), called a time series. Common examples of a time series are daily temperature measurements, monthly sales, and yearly population figures.

aVA topological sort is a permutation p of the vertices of a graph such that an edge {i, j} implies that i appears before j in p. Only acyclic digraphs can be topologically sorted.

aVTopology is the mathematical study of the properties that are preserved through deformations, twistings, and stretchings of objects. Tearing, however, is not allowed. A circle is topologically equivalent to an ellipse (into which it can be deformed by stretching) and a sphere is equivalent to an ellipsoid. Similarly, the set of all possible positions of the hour hand of a clock is topologically equivalent to a circle (i.e., a one-dimensional closed curve with no intersections that can be embedded in two-dimensional space), the set of all possible positions of the hour and minute hands taken together is topologically equivalent to the surface of a torus (i.e., a two-dimensional a surface that can be embedded in three-dimensional space), and the set of all possible positions of the hour, minute, and second hands taken together are topologically equivalent to a three-dimensional object.\u000aThe definition of topology leads to the following mathematical joke:\u000aQ: What is a topologist? A: Someone who cannot distinguish between a doughnut and a coffee cup.\u000aThere is more to topology, though. Topology began with the study of curves, surfaces, and other objects in the plane and three-space. One of the central ideas in topology is that spatial objects like circles and spheres can be treated as objects in their own right, and knowledge of objects is independent of how they are "represented" or "embedded" in space. For example, the statement "if you remove a point from a circle, you get a line segment" applies just as well to the circle as to an ellipse, and even to tangled or knotted circles, since the statement involves only topological properties.\u000aTopology has to do with the study of spatial objects such as curves, surfaces, the space we call our universe, the space-time of general relativity, fractals, knots, manifolds (which are objects with some of the same basic spatial properties as our universe), phase spaces that are encountered in physics (such as the space of hand-positions of a clock), symmetry groups like the collection of ways of rotating a top, etc.\u000aTopology can be used to abstract the inherent connectivity of objects while ignoring their detailed form. For example, the figures above illustrate the connectivity of a number of topologically distinct surfaces. In these figures, parallel edges drawn in solid join one another with the orientation indicated with arrows, so corners labeled with the same letter correspond to the same point, and dashed lines show edges that remain free (Gardner 1971, pp. 15-17; Gray 1997, pp. 322-324). The above figures correspond to the disk (plane), Klein bottle, Möbius strip, real projective plane, sphere, torus, and tube. The labels are often omitted in such diagrams since they are implied by connection of parallel lines with the orientations indicated by the arrows.\u000aThe "objects" of topology are often formally defined as topological spaces. If two objects have the same topological properties, they are said to be homeomorphic (although, strictly speaking, properties that are not destroyed by stretching and distorting an object are really properties preserved by isotopy, not homeomorphism; isotopy has to do with distorting embedded objects, while homeomorphism is intrinsic).\u000aAround 1900, Poincaré formulated a measure of an object's topology, called homotopy. In particular, two mathematical objects are said to be homotopic if one can be continuously deformed into the other.\u000aTopology can be divided into algebraic topology (which includes combinatorial topology), differential topology, and low-dimensional topology. The low-level language of topology, which is not really considered a separate "branch" of topology, is known as point-set topology.\u000aThere is also a formal definition for a topology defined in terms of set operations. A set X along with a collection T of subsets of it is said to be a topology if the subsets in T obey the following properties: \u000a1. The (trivial) subsets X and the empty set \u2205 are in T. \u000a2. Whenever sets A and B are in T, then so is A intersection B. \u000a3. Whenever two or more sets are in T, then so is their union \u000a(Bishop and Goldberg 1980). This definition can be used to enumerate the topologies on n symbols. For example, the unique topology of order 1 is {\u2205, {1}}, while the four topologies of order 2 are {\u2205, {1}, {1, 2}}, {\u2205, {1, 2}}, {\u2205, {1, 2}, {2}}, and {\u2205, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}}. The numbers of topologies on sets of cardinalities n = 1, 2, ... are 1, 4, 29, 355, 6942, ... (OEIS A000798).\u000aA set X for which a topology T has been specified is called a topological space. For example, the set X = {1, 2, 3, 4} together with the subsets T = {\u2205, {1}, {2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 4}} comprises a topology, and X is a topological space.\u000aTopologies can be built up from topological bases. For the real numbers, a topological basis is the set of open intervals.

aVA divergenceless field can be partitioned into a toroidal and a poloidal part. This separation is important in geo- and heliophysics, and in particular in dynamo theory and helioseismology. The toroidal field is defined as\u000aT = - 1/(sin\u03b8)d/(d\u03d5) u(\u03b8, \u03d5)\u03b8^^ + d/(d\u03b8) u(\u03b8, \u03d5)\u03d5^^, which can additionally be multiplied by a radial weighting function w(r).\u000aThis is equivalent to the definition\u000aT = - w(r)·r^^x del _horizontal u(\u03b8, \u03d5), where u is a scalar function and the gradient is taken in spherical coordinates.
p1919
aVA toroidal polyhedron is a polyhedron with genus g>=1 (i.e., one having one or more holes). Examples of toroidal polyhedra include the Császár polyhedron and Szilassi polyhedron, both of which have genus 1 (i.e., the topology of a torus).

aVThe torsion of a space curve, sometimes also called the "second curvature", is the rate of change of the curve's osculating plane. The torsion \u03c4 is positive for a right-handed curve, and negative for a left-handed curve. A curve with curvature \u03ba!=0 is planar iff \u03c4 = 0.\u000aThe torsion can be defined by\u000a\u03c4 congruent - N·B', where N is the unit normal vector and B is the unit binormal vector.

aVAn (ordinary) torus is a surface having genus one, and therefore possessing a single "hole". The single-holed "ring" torus is known in older literature as an "anchor ring." It can be constructed from a rectangle by gluing both pairs of opposite edges together with no twists (right figure; Gardner 1971, pp. 15-17; Gray 1997, pp. 323-324). The usual torus embedded in three-dimensional space is shaped like a donut, but the concept of the torus is extremely useful in higher dimensional space as well.

aVThe number of colors sufficient for map coloring on a surface of genus g is given by the Heawood conjecture, \u03c7(g) = \u230a1/2(7 + sqrt(48g + 1))\u230b, where \u230ax\u230b is the floor function. The fact that \u03c7(g) (which is called the chromatic number) is also necessary was proved by Ringel and Youngs with two exceptions: the sphere (which requires the same number of colors as the plane) and the Klein bottle.

aVGiven a complex measure \u03bc, there exists a positive measure denoted left bracketing bar \u03bc right bracketing bar which measures the total variation of \u03bc, also sometimes called simply "total variation." In particular, left bracketing bar \u03bc right bracketing bar (E) on a subset E is the largest sum of "variations" for any subdivision of E. Roughly speaking, a total variation measure is an infinitesimal version of the absolute value.\u000aMore precisely, left bracketing bar \u03bc right bracketing bar (E) = sup sum_i left bracketing bar \u03bc(E_i) right bracketing bar \u000awhere the supremum is taken over all partitions union E_i of E into measurable subsets E_i.

aVThe tower of Hanoi (commonly also known as the "towers of Hanoi"), is a puzzle invented by E. Lucas in 1883. It is also known as the Tower of Brahma puzzle and appeared as an intelligence test for apes in the film Rise of the Planet of the Apes under the name "Lucas Tower."\u000aGiven a stack of n disks arranged from largest on the bottom to smallest on top placed on a rod, together with two empty rods, the towers of Hanoi puzzle asks for the minimum number of moves required to move the stack from one rod to another, where moves are allowed only if they place smaller disks on top of larger disks. The puzzle with n = 4 pegs and n disks is sometimes known as Reve's puzzle.

aVThe tractrix arises in the following problem posed to Leibniz: What is the path of an object starting off with a vertical offset when it is dragged along by a string of constant length being pulled along a straight horizontal line? By associating the object with a dog, the string with a leash, and the pull along a horizontal line with the dog's master, the curve has the descriptive name "hundkurve" (dog curve) in German. Leibniz found the curve using the fact that the axis is an asymptote to the tractrix (MacTutor Archive).

aVTransfinite induction, like regular induction, is used to show a property P(n) holds for all numbers n. The essential difference is that regular induction is restricted to the natural numbers Z^*, which are precisely the finite ordinal numbers.

aVA transpose of a doubly indexed object is the object obtained by replacing all elements a_(ij) with a_(ji). For a second-tensor rank tensor a_(ij), the tensor transpose is simply a_(ji). The matrix transpose, most commonly written A^T, is the matrix obtained by exchanging A's rows and columns, and satisfies the identity\u000a(A^T)^(-1) = (A^(-1))^T .\u000aUnfortunately, several other notations are commonly used, as summarized in the following table. The notation A^T is used in this work.

aVAn exchange of two elements of an ordered list with all others staying the same. A transposition is therefore a permutation of two elements. For example, the swapping of 2 and 5 to take the list 123456 to 153426 is a transposition. The permutation symbol \u03f5_(ijk...) is defined as (-1)^n, where n is the number of transpositions of pairs of elements that must be composed to build up the permutation.

aVA tree is a mathematical structure that can be viewed as either a graph or as a data structure. The two views are equivalent, since a tree data structure contains not only a set of elements, but also connections between elements, giving a tree graph.\u000aTrees were first studied by Cayley.

If a triangular orthobicupola is oriented with triangles on top and bottom, the two halves may be rotated one sixth of a turn with respect to each other to obtain the cuboctahedron.\u000aIn hexagonal close packing, layers of spheres are packed so that spheres in alternating layers overlie one another. As in cubic close packing, each sphere is surrounded by 12 other spheres. Taking a collection of 13 such spheres gives the cluster illustrated above.

aVTriangulation is the division of a surface or plane polygon into a set of triangles, usually with the restriction that each triangle side is entirely shared by two adjacent triangles. It was proved in 1925 that every surface has a triangulation, but it might require an infinite number of triangles and the proof is difficult. A surface with a finite number of triangles in its triangulation is called compact.

aVThe study of angles and of the angular relationships of planar and three-dimensional figures is known as trigonometry. The trigonometric functions (also called the circular functions) comprising trigonometry are the cosecant cscx, cosine cosx, cotangent cotx, secant secx, sine sinx, and tangent tanx. The inverses of these functions are denoted csc^(-1) x, cos^(-1) x, cot^(-1) x, sec^(-1) x, sin^(-1) x, and tan^(-1) x. Note that the f^(-1) notation here means inverse function, not f to the -1 power.

aVIn 1704, Sebastien Truchet considered all possible patterns formed by tilings of right triangles oriented at the four corners of a square.\u000aTruchet's tiles produce beautiful patterns when laid out on a grid, as illustrated by the 20×20 arrangement of random tiles illustrated above.\u000aA modification of Truchet's tiles leads to a single tile consisting of two circular arcs of radius equal to half the tile edge length centered at opposed corners. There are two possible orientations of this tile, and tiling the plane using tiles with random orientations gives visually interesting patterns. In fact, these tiles have been used in the construction of various games, including the "black path game" and "meander" .

aVA truth table is a two-dimensional array with n + 1 columns. The first n columns correspond to the possible values of n inputs, and the last column to the operation being performed.

aVA tube of radius r of a set \u03b3 is the set of points at a distance r from \u03b3. In particular, if \u03b3(t) is a regular space curve whose curvature does not vanish, then the normal vector and binormal vector are always perpendicular to \u03b3, and the circle N^^(t) cos\u03b8 + B^^(t) sin\u03b8 is perpendicular to \u03b3 at \u03b3(t). So as the circle moves around \u03b3, it traces out a tube, provided the tube radius r is small enough so that the tube is not self-intersecting. A formula for the tube around a curve is therefore given by\u000aS(t, \u03b8) = \u03b3(t) + r[-N^^(t) cos\u03b8 + B^^(t) sin\u03b8],

aVA Turing machine is a theoretical computing machine invented by Alan Turing to serve as an idealized model for mathematical calculation. A Turing machine consists of a line of cells known as a "tape" that can be moved back and forth, an active element known as the "head" that possesses a property known as "state" and that can change the property known as "color" of the active cell underneath it, and a set of instructions for how the head should modify the active cell and move the tape. At each step, the machine may modify the color of the active cell and change the state of the head. After this, it moves the tape one unit to the left or right.

aVTurmites, also called turning machines, are 2-dimensional Turing machines in which the "tape" consists of a grid of spaces that can be written and erased by an active ("head") element that turns at each iteration on the basis of the state of its current grid square. The "head" of the system is usually called a "vant, " "ant, " or "turmite" on square grids, and a "bee, " "worm, " or "turtle" on hexagonal grids. (The term "turtle" is named after Seymour Papert's turtle geometry). The turmite tracks its position, direction, and current state.

aVAn unfolding is the cutting along edges and flattening out of a polyhedron to form a net. Determining how to unfold a polyhedron into a net is tricky. For example, cuts cannot be made along all edges that surround a face or the face will completely separate. Furthermore, for a polyhedron with no coplanar faces, at least one edge cut must be made from each vertex or else the polyhedron will not flatten. In fact, the edges that must be cut corresponds to a special kind of graph called a spanning tree of the skeleton of the polyhedron (Malkevitch).

aVA unit circle is a circle of unit radius, i.e., of radius 1.\u000aThe unit circle plays a significant role in a number of different areas of mathematics. For example, the functions of trigonometry are most simply defined using the unit circle. As shown in the figure above, a point P on the terminal side of an angle \u03b8 in angle standard position measured along an arc of the unit circle has as its coordinates (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8) so that cos\u03b8 is the horizontal coordinate of P and sin\u03b8 is its vertical component.\u000aAs a result of this definition, the trigonometric functions are periodic with period 2\u03c0.

aVThe utility problem posits three houses and three utility companies--say, gas, electric, and water--and asks if each utility can be connected to each house without having any of the gas/water/electric lines/pipes pass over any other. This is equivalent to the equation "Can a planar graph be constructed from each of three nodes ('houses') to each of three other nodes ('utilities')?" This problem was first posed in this form by H. E. Dudeney in 1917.

aVThe validity of a logical argument refers to whether or not the conclusion follows logically from the premises, i.e., whether it is possible to deduce the conclusion from the premises and the allowable syllogisms of the logical system being used. If it is possible to do so, the argument is said to be valid; otherwise it is invalid. A classical example of a valid argument is the following:\u000aAll men are mortal.\u000aSocrates is a man.\u000aTherefore Socrates is mortal.

Then van Aubel's theorem states that the two lines are of equal length and cross at a right angle.\u000avan Aubel's theorem is related to Napoleon's theorem and is a special case of the Petr-Neumann-Douglas theorem. It is sometimes (incorrectly) known simply as Aubel's theorem.\u000aA second theorem sometimes known as van Aubel's theorem states that if \u0394A' B' C' is the Cevian triangle of a point P, then\u000a(AP)/(PA') = (AB')/(B' C) + (AC')/(C' B).

aVThe van der Pol equation is an ordinary differential equation that can be derived from the Rayleigh differential equation by differentiating and setting y = y'. It is an equation describing self-sustaining oscillations in which energy is fed into small oscillations and removed from large oscillations.

aVA variable is a symbol on whose value a function, polynomial, etc., depends. For example, the variables in the function f(x, y) are x and y. A function having a single variable is said to be univariate, one having two variables is said to be bivariate, and one having two or more variables is said to be multivariate. In a polynomial, the variables correspond to the base symbols themselves stripped of coefficients and any powers or products.

aVFor a single variate X having a distribution P(x) with known population mean \u03bc, the population variance var(X), commonly also written \u03c3^2, is defined as\u000a\u03c3^2 congruent \u2329(X - \u03bc)^2 \u232a, where \u03bc is the population mean and \u2329X\u232a denotes the expectation value of X. For a discrete distribution with N possible values of x_i, the population variance is therefore\u000a\u03c3^2 = sum_(i = 1)^N P(x_i)(x_i - \u03bc)^2, whereas for a continuous distribution, it is given by\u000a\u03c3^2 = integral P(x)(x - \u03bc)^2 dx.

aVA vector is formally defined as an element of a vector space. In the commonly encountered vector space R^n (i.e., Euclidean n-space), a vector is given by n coordinates and can be specified as (A_1, A_2, ..., A_n). Vectors are sometimes referred to by the number of coordinates they have, so a 2-dimensional vector (x_1, x_2) is often called a two-vector, an n-dimensional vector is often called an n-vector, and so on.
p2018
aVVector addition is the operation of adding two or more vectors together into a vector sum.\u000aThe so-called parallelogram law gives the rule for vector addition of two or more vectors. For two vectors A and B, the vector sum A + B is obtained by placing them head to tail and drawing the vector from the free tail to the free head. In Cartesian coordinates, vector addition can be performed simply by adding the corresponding components of the vectors, so if A = (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) and B = (b_1, b_2, ..., b_n), A + B = (a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2, ..., a_n + b_n).

A vector difference is denoted using the normal minus sign, i.e., the vector difference of vectors A and B is written A - B.\u000aA vector difference is equivalent to a vector sum with the orientation of the second vector reversed, i.e., A - B = A + (-B).

Consequently, if (v_1, v_2, ..., v_n) is a list of vectors in V, then these vectors form a vector basis if and only if every v element V can be uniquely written as\u000av = a_1 v_1 + a_2 v_2 + ... + a_n v_n, where a_1, ..., a_n are elements of the base field.

aVIf W is a k-dimensional subspace of a vector space V with inner product \u2329, \u232a, then it is possible to project vectors from V to W. The most familiar projection is when W is the x-axis in the plane. In this case, P(x, y) = (x, 0) is the projection. This projection is an orthogonal projection.\u000aIf the subspace W has an orthonormal basis {w_1, ..., w_k} then\u000aproj_W(v) = sum_(i = 1)^k \u2329v, w_i\u232a w_i\u000ais the orthogonal projection onto W.

The vertex degree is also called the local degree or valency. The ordered list of vertex degrees in a given graph is called its degree sequence. A list of vertex degrees of a graph can be computed in the Wolfram Language using VertexDegree[g], and precomputed vertex degrees are available for particular embeddings of many named graphs via GraphData[graph, VertexDegrees].\u000aThe minimum vertex degree in a graph G is denoted \u03b4(G), and the maximum vertex degree is denoted \u0394(G).

aVThe voter model is a simple mathematical model of opinion formation in which voters are located at the nodes of a network, each voter has an opinion (in the simplest case, 0 or 1, but in the general case, n), and a randomly chosen voter assumes the opinion of one of its neighbors.\u000aThis model can be used to describe the phase transition behavior of idealized physical systems and can result in a rather remarkable amount of structure starting from a given "random" input." It can be modeled very easily using cellular automata.\u000aIt turns out that in finite networks (i.e., any real model), fluctuations always cause the system to reach an "absorbing" (i.e., constant) state.

aVThe Walsh functions consist of trains of square pulses (with the allowed states being -1 and 1) such that transitions may only occur at fixed intervals of a unit time step, the initial state is always +1, and the functions satisfy certain other orthogonality relations. In particular, the 2^n Walsh functions of order n are given by the rows of the Hadamard matrix H_2^n when arranged in so-called "sequency" order (Thompson et al. 1986, p. 204; Wolfram 2002, p. 1073).

The curve is produced by a linkage of rods connecting two wheels of equal diameter. Let the two wheels have radius b and let their centers be located a distance 2a apart. Further suppose that a rod of length 2c is fixed at each end to the circumference of the two wheels. Let P be the midpoint of the rod. Then Watt's curve C is the locus of P.\u000aThe polar equation of Watt's curve is\u000ar^2 = b^2 - (asin\u03b8 ± sqrt(c^2 - a^2 cos^2 \u03b8))^2 .

aVWavelets are a class of a functions used to localize a given function in both space and scaling. A family of wavelets can be constructed from a function \u03c8(x), sometimes known as a "mother wavelet, " which is confined in a finite interval. "Daughter wavelets" \u03c8^(a, b)(x) are then formed by translation (b) and contraction (a). Wavelets are especially useful for compressing image data, since a wavelet transform has properties which are in some ways superior to a conventional Fourier transform.\u000aAn individual wavelet can be defined by\u000a\u03c8^(a, b)(x) = ( left bracketing bar a right bracketing bar )^(-1/2) \u03c8((x - b)/a).

aVA web diagram, also called a cobweb plot, is a graph that can be used to visualize successive iterations of a function y = f(x). In particular, the segments of the diagram connect the points (x, f(x)), (f(x), f(f(x))), (f(f(x)), f(f(f(x)))), .... The diagram is so-named because its straight line segments "anchored" to the functions y = x and y = f(x) can resemble a spider web. The animation above shows a web diagram for the logistic map f(x) = rx(1 - x) with r = 3.741.

The curve is also known as cubique d'Agnesi or agnésienne, and had been studied earlier by Fermat and Guido Grandi in 1703.\u000aThe name "witch" derives from a mistranslation of the term averisera ("versed sine curve, " from the Latin vertere, "to turn") in the original work as avversiera ("witch" or "wife of the devil") in an 1801 translation of the work by Cambridge Lucasian Professor of Mathematics John Colson (Gray).
