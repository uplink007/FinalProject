We will use the artificial dataset given in Fig 4 which displays 4 different patterns of gap threading .
A segmentation method ( e . g . , TextTiling ( Hearst , 1997 ) ) generally segments a text into blocks ( paragraphs ) in accord with topic changes within the text , but it does not identify ( or label ) by itself the topics discussed in each of the blocks .
2 Taking each category of the three in turn , problematic constructs included : cordination , punctuation , treating ditransitive VPs as being transitive VPs , confusions regarding adjective or adverbial phrases , and copulars seen as being possessives .
The default category of a tag is given by the ration between its number of occurrences in the structure we want to recognise and the number of occurrences in the training corpus .
The second 56 measure is the probability of correct classification .

Since indicative summaries alert users to document content , any measure that evaluates the quality of an indicative summary ought to consider the similarity of the content of the summary to the content of the full document .
For ANFIS , the set of sentence-question pairs was divided into five groups according to question type .
We present measures to evaluate filtering performance and preliminary results on Spanish , Arabic and Haitian Creole FALCon systems .
For example , if a sentence mentioning a new entity is included in a summary , one might also want to include a sentence that puts the entity in the context of the re§t of the article or cluster .
Regardless of this , there is a ceiling on the performance of these systems at around 80 % token recall. Where token recall is the percentage of SCF tokens in a sample of manually analysed text that were The approaches to extracting SCF information from corpora have frequently employed statistical methods for filtering .

If a noun is the object of a verb , then the subcat feature value of the verb can be used to disambiguate its word sense ( e.g. , take generally has the subcat of obj+time ) .
Though the analysis complexity can be reduced by segmenting a sentence , there is a mis-segmentation risk that causes parsing failures .
Thus , a treecut corresponds to one of the levels of abstraction in the tree .
( 1 ) If the English translation corresponds to only one symet , this symet is the solution .
The merged model , on the other hand , does not reach this peak , but overfitting is not present .

Topic analysis consists of two main tasks : topic identification and text segmentation ( based on topic changes ) .
Finally , an nn . qpeci~ed object required as an argument to a predicate can appear elsewhere in the sentence , requiring the use of the predicate const ( X , C ) to bind the variable X to the constant C . Some other database queries ( or training examples ) for the U . S . Geography domain are shown below : What is the capital of Texas ?
Because supervised training typically demands significant human involvement ( e . g . , annotating the parse trees of sentences by hand ) , building a new corpus is a labor-intensive task .

The first is a sire• ple heuristic that approximates the grammar ' s uncertainty in terms of sentence lengths .
With ECOC , monadic classes are replaced by codewords , i.e .
The categories and rules in the grammar are defined as types in the hierarchy , represented in terms of TDFSS and the feature structures associated with any given category or rule are defined by the inheritance chain .
An intimate relationship between the two issues is becoming apparent for example , in the consideration of translation equivalence in parallel corpora , the construction of mullilingual ontologies , and the examination of senses in relation to specific natural language applications such as machine translation , information retrieval , summarization , etc .
Our key interest in this work was to provide a system which allowed users to get answers : not just documents or sub-documents .

The degree expression SPACE , with its associated negative POL -- MARKER , ( Staab and Hahn , 1997 ) is the trigger for recognizing the evaluative status of the matrix clause .
The metric M ( H ) used as the search heuristic is defined as : M ( H ) = accuracy ( H ) + C log 2 size ( H ) ( 4 ) where C is a constant used to control the relative weight of accuracy vs. complexity .
Experiment 2 : sets of senses that have parallel translations in at least one out of the four target languages .
The answer U7 is a valid response to $ 6 and produces a new OPM , see figure 14 .
The motivation for this is obvious : when a summarization filter ( which is a program under our control ) is generating a media object , we can often provide sufficient recta-information about that object to generate a short caption and some running text .

Rather , I intend to put forth the conjecture that syntax acquisition is extremely sensirive to the distribution of ambiguity , and , given this extreme sensitivity , suggest that simulation studies need to be conducted in conjunction with a broader analysis which abstracts away from whatever linguistic particulars are necessary to bring about the sentences required to build the input sample that feeds the simulated learner .
Weighted accuracy is a measure that weights higher the hits and misses 100 for the preferred class .
However , as higher values of k lead to an enormous number of possible rules , huge data sets would be necessary in order to have a reliable estimate of the probabilities for values above k = 3 .
The measures proposed include lapse supplementary budget and record public works spending in the firso half of ohe financial year .
If F o ( e i ) > 0 , we define the lexical entry ei as positive for lexicon ~ .
There are two types of situations in which multidocument summarization would be useful : ( 1 ) the user is faced with a collection of dis-similar documents and wishes to assess the information landscape contained in the collection , or ( 2 ) there is a collection of topicallyrelated documents , extracted from a larger more diverse collection as the result of a query , or a topically-cohesive cluster .

The learning system is equipped with a UG and associated parameters , encoded as a Unification-Based Generalised Categorial Grammar , and a learning algorithm that fixes the values of the parameters to a particular language .
The Common CJK Ideograph section of the Unicode encoding scheme includes all characters encoded in each individual language and encoding scheme .
For the learner , the information about subjects ( subjdir = backward ) has already been acquired while learning intransitive verbs , and the learner does not need to learn it again for transitive verbs , which not only inherit this information , but also have the direction for the object defined by vargdir ( vargdir = forward ) , as shown in figure 3 .
For a given data sequence z m = xl . . . zm and for a fixed probability model M , 1 the stochastic complexity of x m relative to M , which we denote as SC ( x m : M ) , is defined as the least code length required to encode x rn with M ( Rissanen , 1996 ) .

Similarly , PLNLP ( Heidorn , 1972 ; Jensen et al . , 1993 ) is a programming language for writing phrase structure rules that include specific conditions under which the rule can be applied .
The set of segmentable positions T~ is defined somewhat differently as : : D = { wi , wsj I ( Icc , v , -= lcc~ , ) = 1 or ( Icws~ =-IcC.ws~ ) = 1 } , where wsj denotes a word set to which the jth word in a sentence belongs .
In the present approach , parses are ranked according to their goodness by a statistical model built using the maximum entropy technique , which involves building a distribution over events which is the most uniform possible , given constraints derived from training data .
Resuming the example shown in Figure 1 , this is the case of the UW `` on '' in ( lb ) : the preposition 'on ' fills in the position feature of the verb 'sit ' and , thus , is represented in UNL correspondingly as the second term of the binary relation 'plc ' and the first term of 'obj ' .

Related to this , ( Freitag , 1998 ) uses words to learn only slot rules ( learned from text-relation examples ) , selecting as negative those non-positive word pairs that define a string as neither longer than the maximum length in positive examples , nor shorter than the minimum .
Section 5 describes the user interface of the system .
Figure 2 : Annotation Scheme for Argumentative Zones Our hypothesis is that a segmentation based on regularities of scientific argumentation and on attribution of intellectual ownership is one of the most stable and generalizable dimensions which contribute to the structure of scientific texts .
Since the central barrier to developing such a system today is the incompleteness of the knowledge base , we outline a strategy starting with the implementation of a series of form-based resolution algorithms that are applied directly to the referring expressions of the input text .
When the training corpus consists of a large reservoir of fully annotated parse trees , it is possible to directly extract a grammar based on these parse trees .
Article choice is particularly important for this application : many AAC users drop articles and resort to a sort of telegraphese , but this causes degradation in comprehension of synthetic speech and contributes to its perception as unnatural and robot-like .

A textual document is a sequence of terms .
In the present context , however , the limitation is inessential , since what is crucial here is the interaction between an Adjective and a ( possibly complex ) Common Noun following it : in more complex constructs of the form ' NP and the Adj CN ' , only CN affects the meaning of Adj .
Instead other types require additional re-generation : for the topic of the document template the generation procedure is as follows : ( i ) the verb form for the predicate in the Predicate slot is generated in the present tense ( topical information is always reported in present tense ) , 3rd person of singular in active voice at the beginning of the sentence ; ( ii ) the parsed sentence fragment from the N ' hat slot is generated in the middle of the sentence ( so the appropriate case for the first element ) .
( If there is neither possessor nor determiner then the grammar considers the np-type : if it is COMMON , it uses NO ( for indefinite ) and if it is PROPER , it uses NOART The number feature passed is the value passed from the determiner , if there is one , or the value from the current template .

Given a sentence• S and a type of information T the system verifies if the sentence matches some of the patterns associated with type T. For each matched pattern , the system extracts information from the sentence and instantiates a template of type T. For example , the Content slot of the problem identification template is instantiated with all the sentence • : ( avoiding references , structural elements and parenthetical expressions ) while the What slot 'of the topic of the document template is instantiated with a parsed sentence fragment • to the left or to the right of the make known relation depending on the attribute voice of the verb ( active vs. passive ) .

4.3 Performance Measures Our experiments adopt the most commonly used performance measures , including the recall , precision , and F1 measures .
TRIPS-911 can currently interpret expressions with respect to the actual time .
57 etrees .
And hence , there is a difference between fish ISA creature and fish ISA animal .
Coverage was measured by having human IF specialists annotate unseen data .
The product consists of a tree of handlers , each handler encapsulates processing relevant to a particular schema .
A single scenario for the colour domain In order to learn a rule set for a concept , EVIUS uses the relational learning method explained in section 3 , and defines the learning space by means of a dynamic predicate model .
The MDL is a principle of data compression in Information Theory which states that , for a given dataset , the best model is the one which requires the minimum length ( often measured in bits ) to encode the model ( the model description length ) and the data ( the data description length ) .
The STMs within a text are assumed to have the same set of topics , but have different parameter values .
Preliminary results 1 across three language-specific FALCon 2 systems show that , with one exception , the derived measures consistently yield the same performance ranking : Haitian Creole at the low end , Arabic in the middle , and Spanish at the high end .
Define GoodPotential 0 to I ( S ) as the number of sentences s in the training corpus for which Guess [ s ] =0 , Truth [ s ] = 1 and 3k : ( s , k ) ~ corpus_position_set ( S ) .
our purposes , the number of relevant parameters , r , is the total number of parameters that need to be set in order to license all and only the sentences of the target language .
The motto of such a learner is : Do n't learn . from ambiguous input and learning efficiency can be measured by the number of sentences the learner has to wait for usable , unambiguous inputs to occur in the input stream .
The test set here consists of the 3260 manually classified senses .
