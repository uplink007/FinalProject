# Matt Cale, a reviewer for Ruthlessreviews.com, said: "Based on my initial, purely gut reaction, TARGET is a visual masterpiece, but also the sort of story that contains layer after layer of insight. I wouldn̢���t argue that I understood everything after one viewing, but I̢���m so intrigued that I want to read more reviews, scan a few clips, and even revisit the film in its entirety. It̢���s the sort of film made for contemplation; so mysterious and so blissfully unconcerned with immediate gratification that I have no doubt it will begin the slow climb up the list of films near and dear to my heart." Members of Variety opened their review with: "Raw fare is sometimes high adventure and exciting, at other times dull in its so-called symbolism. Too often, it turns out to be a pot-pourri of ravenous eating and blatant sex", referring to the films violence and sexual overtones.

# ' Other writers sometimes used similarly harsh language: In March 2000 edition, for instance, an author who used the pen-name 'Big Ben' (Timur ̰�atakl̳�) denounced the Turkish education system with these words: "...Most of the teachers expected us to keep staring at them drooling as they talked, and the rest did not care whether we listened to them or not, since their souls had grown as inert as those of whores. ... (About his physics teacher, who had once beaten one of his friends) He (the teacher) was so disgusting. One day, we heard that he had suffered a stroke, and -I'll never forget that moment- 30 students linked arms and started dancing. Even now I feel that my blood boils: Imagine the rage that lies inside me... Who are you to raise your hands against the child of another man, where do you take that right from? I am disgusted with all you teachers and will never speak of any of you with respect. Your work is by no means sacred, your trade is infamy." One of the major events ever happened in TARGET because of the authors' writing style was occurred in 1998 summer.

# Garth Norman has counted 89 stelae, 61 altars, 3 thrones, and 68 "miscellaneous monuments at Izapa. In contrast to the ruler-oriented sculpture of the Epi-Olmec culture 330 miles (550 km) across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Izapan sculpture has features mythological and religious subjects, and is ceremonial and frequently narrative in nature. Also, in contrast to Epi-Olmec and later Maya stela, TARGET monuments rarely contain glyphs. Although this could imply that the Izapan culture lacked knowledge of any writing system, Julia Guernsey, author of a definitive work on Izapa sculpture, proposes instead that the monuments were intentionally language-free and that "Izapa's position at the juncture of two linguistic regions may have fostered the penchant for non-verbal communicative strategies.
