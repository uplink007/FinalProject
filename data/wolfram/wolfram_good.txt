The two axes of two - dimensional Cartesian coordinates, conventionally denoted the x- and y - axes (a notation due to Descartes), are chosen to be linear and mutually perpendicular.
Typically, the x - axis is thought of as the " left and right " or horizontal axis while the y - axis is thought of as the " up and down " or vertical axis.
