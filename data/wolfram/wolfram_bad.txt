In general, if n objects are placed into k boxes, then there exists at least one box containing at least ⌈n / k⌉ objects, where ⌈x⌉ is the ceiling function.
This result had been conjectured by Gauss, but was first proved by Dirichlet.
Dirichlet proved this theorem using Dirichlet L - series, but the proof is challenging enough that, in their classic text on number theory, the usually explicit Hardy and Wright report " this theorem is too difficult for insertion in this book.

Abramowitz and Stegun give a table of the parameters of most common discrete distributions.
A tetrahedron 10-compound, octahedron 5-compound, cube 5-compound, icosahedron, dodecahedron, and icosidodecahedron can be inscribed in the vertices of a disdyakis triacontahedron. 
Because the area element is given by dA = 2πrdr, this gives a concentration of points in the center (left figure above).
Any two rectilinear figures with equal area can be dissected into a finite number of pieces to form each other.
The triangle to square dissection (haberdasher's problem) is particularly interesting because it can be built from hinged pieces which can be folded and unfolded to yield the two shapes.
Furthermore, any shape whose boundary is composed of smoothly curving pieces can be dissected into a square.
In order to produce this illusion, the pieces have to be cut and reassembled so skillfully, that the missing or exceeding area is hidden by tiny, negligible imperfections of shape.
The symbol del is variously known as " nabla " or " del.
Taking the ratio x / y of two numbers x and y, also written x÷y.
The symbol " / " is called a solidus (sometimes, the " diagonal "), and the symbol " ÷ " is called the obelus.
If left unevaluated, x / y is called a fraction, with x known as the numerator and y known as the denominator.
In French, the term " corps non commutatif " is used to mean division algebra, while " corps " alone means field.
The uniqueness of division breaks down when dividing by zero, since the product 0·y = 0 is the same for any y, so y can not be recovered by inverting the process of multiplication.
Examples include the decagonal prism, elongated square dipyramid (Johnson solid J_15), hexagonal dipyramid, metabidiminished icosahedron (J_62), pentagonal antiprism, pentagonal cupola (J_5), (regular) dodecahedron, rhombic dodecahedron, snub disphenoid (J_84), triakis tetrahedron, and undecagonal pyramid.

The answer is r = ϕ - 1 = 1/ϕ = 0.618034..., where ϕ is the golden ratio, and the centers c_i of the disks i = 1,..., 5 are located at c_i = [ 1/ϕ cos((2πi)/5) 1/ϕ sin((2πi)/5)].
The fixed point of a function f starting from an initial value x can be computed in the Wolfram Language using FixedPoint[f, x].
Similarly, to get a list of the values obtained by iterating the function until a fixed point is reached, the command FixedPointList[f, x] can be used.

 A point related to the construction and properties of conic sections.
Hyperbolas and noncircular ellipses have two distinct foci and two associated conic section directrices, each directrix being perpendicular to the line joining the two foci.
 There are many mathematical and recreational problems related to folding.
Origami, the Japanese art of paper folding, is one well - known example.
It is possible to make a surprising variety of shapes by folding a piece of paper multiple times, making one complete straight cut, then unfolding.
For example, a five - pointed star can be produced after four folds, as can a polygonal swan, butterfly, and angelfish.
Amazingly, every polygonal shape can be produced this way, as can any disconnected combination of polygonal shapes.

 Pick any two relatively prime integers h and k, then the circle C(h, k) of radius 1/(2k^2) centered at (h / k, ± 1/(2k^2)) is known as a Ford circle.
No matter what and how many hs and ks are picked, none of the Ford circles intersect (and all are tangent to the x - axis).
This can be seen by examining the squared distance between the centers of the circles with (h, k) and (h ', k '), d^2 = (h'/k ' - h / k)^2 + (1/(2k^ (, 2)) - 1/(2k^2))^2.

Fourier series make use of the orthogonality relationships of the sine and cosine functions.
The computation and study of Fourier series is known as harmonic analysis and is extremely useful as a way to break up an arbitrary periodic function into a set of simple terms that can be plugged in, solved individually, and then recombined to obtain the solution to the original problem or an approximation to it to whatever accuracy is desired or practical.
Examples of successive approximations to common functions using Fourier series are illustrated above.

Illustrated above are the fractals known as the Gosper island, Koch snowflake, box fractal, Sierpiński sieve, Barnsley's fern, and Mandelbrot set.
 The study of an extension of derivatives and integrals to noninteger orders.
Fractional calculus is based on the definition of the fractional integral as D^(-ν) f(t) = 1/(Γ(ν)) integral_0^t (t - ξ)^(ν - 1) f(ξ) dξ, where Γ(ν) is the gamma function.
From this equation, fractional derivatives can also be defined.
 The fractional derivative of f(t) of order μ>0 (if it exists) can be defined in terms of the fractional integral D^(-ν) f(t) as D^μ f(t) = D^m[D^(-(m - μ)) f(t)], where m is an integer > = ⌈μ⌉, where ⌈x⌉ is the ceiling function.
The semiderivative corresponds to μ = 1/2.
 The function frac(x) giving the fractional (noninteger) part of a real number x. The symbol { x } is sometimes used instead of frac(x) (Graham et al.
1994, p. 70 ; Havil 2003, p. 109), but this notation is not used in this work due to possible confusion with the set containing the element x. Unfortunately, there is no universal agreement on the meaning of frac(x) for x<0 and there are two common definitions.
 An optical illusion named after British psychologist James Fraser, who first studied the illusion in 1908.
The illusion is also known as the false spiral, or by its original name, the twisted cord illusion.
While the image appears to be a spiral formed by a rope containing twisted strands of two different colors, it actually consists of concentric circles of twisted cords.
The visual distortion is produced by combining a regular line pattern (the circles) with misaligned parts (the differently colored strands).
Zöllner's illusion and the café wall illusion are based on a similar principle, like many other visual effects, in which a sequence of tilted elements causes the eye to perceive phantom twists and deviations.
 The ratio of two independent estimates of the variance of a normal distribution.
The metric consists of a distance function on the plane such that for all a, b element R^2, d(a, b) = { |a - b| | if a = cb for some c element R  |a| + |b| | otherwise, auto right match where |a| is the normal distance function on the plane.
This metric has the property that for r < |a|, the open ball of radius r around a is an open line segment along vector a, while for r > |a|, the open ball is the union of a line segment and an open disk around the origin.
 Also known as the Serret - Frenet formulas, these vector differential equations relate inherent properties of a parametrized curve.
In matrix form, they can be written [ T^. N^. B^.] = [ 0 | κ | 0 -κ | 0 | τ 0 | -τ | 0][T N B], where T is the unit tangent vector, N is the unit normal vector, B is the unit binormal vector, τ is the torsion, κ is the curvature, and x^. denotes dx / ds.

 In general, a frieze consists of repeated copies of a single motif.
 | b | a | | d  | c | Conway and Guy define a frieze pattern as an arrangement of numbers at the intersection of two sets of perpendicular diagonals such that a + d = b + c + 1 (for an additive frieze pattern) or ad = bc + 1 (for a multiplicative frieze pattern) in each diamond.
As an example, if the a_i values are 4 and 9, then 23 is the largest unsolvable number.
Finding the Frobenius number of a given problem is known as the coin problem.
 The circumcircle of the Fuhrmann triangle.
It has the line HNa, where H is the orthocenter and Na is the Nagel point, as its diameter.
In fact, these points (Kimberling centers X_4 and X_8, respectively), are the only Kimberling centers lying on it.
While H and Na are the only noteworthy triangle centers to lie on the circle, a total of at least six other noteworthy points lie on the Fuhrmann circle.
Three of these are the points T, U, and V which are a distance 2r along the altitudes from the vertices, where r is the inradius of ΔABC.
 Let the opposite sides of a convex cyclic hexagon be a, a ', b, b ', c, and c ', and let the polygon diagonals e, f, and g be so chosen that a, a ', and e have no common polygon vertex (and likewise for b, b ', and f), then efg = aa ' e + bb ' f + cc ' g + abc + a ' b ' c '.
This is an extension of Ptolemy's theorem to the hexagon.
 A prime p for which 1/p has a maximal period decimal expansion of p - 1 digits.
Full reptend primes are sometimes also called long primes (Conway and Guy 1996, pp.
157 - 163 and 166 - 171).
There is a surprising connection between full reptend primes and Fermat primes.
In other words, the multiplicative order of p (mod 10) is p - 1.
For example, 7 is a full reptend prime since (10 ^ 1, 10 ^ 2, 10 ^ 3, 10 ^ 4, 10 ^ 5, 10 ^ 6) congruent (3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1) (mod 7).
More formally, a function from A to B is an object f such that every a element A is uniquely associated with an object f(a) element B. A function is therefore a many - to - one (or sometimes one - to - one) relation.
Here, the set B is called the codomain of f.
 Given a function f(x_1,..., x_n) defined on a domain U, the graph of f is defined as the set of points (which often form a curve or surface) showing the values taken by f over U (or some portion of U).
Technically, for real functions, graphf(x) | congruent | { (x, f(x)) element R^2 :x element U } graphf(x_1,..., x_n) | congruent | { (x_1,..., x_n, f(x_1,..., x_n)) element R^(n + 1) : (x_1,..., x_n) element U}.
Then a closed subset F of S is called a fundamental domain of G in S if S is the union of conjugates of F, i.e., S = union _ (g element G) gF, and the intersection of any two conjugates has no interior.
For example, a fundamental domain of the group of rotations by multiples of 180 ° in R^2 is the upper half - plane { (x, y)|y>=0 } and a fundamental domain of rotations by multiples of 90 ° is the first quadrant { (x, y)|x, y>=0}.
 An extension of two - valued logic such that statements need not be true or false, but may have a degree of truth between 0 and 1.
Such a system can be extremely useful in designing control logic for real - world systems such as elevators.

It is therefore given by parametric equations x(u, v) | = | u y(u, v) | = | (acosv)/u z(u, v) | = | (asinv)/u.
 Let L be an extension field of K, denoted L / K, and let G be the set of automorphisms of L / K, that is, the set of automorphisms σ of L such that σ(x) = x for every x element K, so that K is fixed.
Then G is a group of transformations of L, called the Galois group of L / K. The Galois group of L / K is denoted Gal(L / K) or Aut(L / K).
It consists of an upright board with evenly spaced nails (or pegs) driven into its upper half, where the nails are arranged in staggered order, and a lower half divided into a number of evenly - spaced rectangular slots.
The front of the device is covered with a glass cover to allow viewing of both nails and slots.
In the middle of the upper edge, there is a funnel into which balls can be poured, where the diameter of the balls must be much smaller than the distance between the nails.
The funnel is located precisely above the central nail of the second row so that each ball, if perfectly centered, would fall vertically and directly onto the uppermost point of this nail's surface.
The figure above shows a variant of the board in which only the nails that can potentially be hit by a ball dropped from the funnel are included, leading to a triangular array instead of a rectangular one.
Each time a ball hits one of the nails, it can bounce right (or left) with some probability p (and q = 1 - p).
For symmetrically placed nails, balls will bounce left or right with equal probability, so p = q = 1/2.
Each ball crosses the bottom row hitting the nth peg from the left (where 0<=n<=N - 1) iff it has taken exactly n right turns, which occurs with probability P_p(n|N) = (N n) p^n q^(N - n).
This process therefore gives rise to a binomial distribution of in the heights of heaps of balls in the lower slots.
Some care is needed to obtain these idealized results, however, as the actual distribution of balls depends on physical properties of the setup, including the elasticity of the balls (as characterized by their coefficient of restitution), the radius of the nails, and the offsets of the balls over the funnel's opening when they are dropped.
Let two players each have a finite number of pennies (say, n_1 for player one and n_2 for player two).
Now, flip one of the pennies (from either player), with each player having 50 % probability of winning, and transfer a penny from the loser to the winner.
Now repeat the process until one player has all the pennies.
If the process is repeated indefinitely, the probability that one of the two player will eventually lose all his pennies must be 100 %.
The game was originally called Nash or John, with the latter name at the same time crediting its inventor and referring to the fact that it was frequently played on the tiled floors of bathrooms.
The name Hex was invented in 1952, when a commercial version was issued by the game company Parker Brothers.
The Game of Logic, described by Lewis Carroll -- author of Alice in Wonderland -- in 1887 consists of discussing the meaning of propositions like " Some fresh cakes are sweet, " and is an instructive introduction to the concepts of logic.
The game takes place in a world divided into four quadrants.
In the northwest quadrant, the cakes are fresh and sweet, in the northeast, they are fresh and not - sweet, in the southwest, they are not - fresh and sweet, and in the southeast, they are not - fresh and not - sweet.
The game is played with four red coins and five gray coins.

The oft - studied golden ratio ϕ has a number of equivalent definitions framed in a variety of different contexts.
ϕ is the unique positive real number for which the identity ϕ/1 = 1/(ϕ - 1).
The constant ϕ and its various properties have been studied since antiquity with various constructions attributed to Euclid and Pythogoras, among others.
{ ϕ^(n + 1)}_(n = -1)^∞ and { ψ^(n + 1)}_(n = -1)^∞ are both solutions to the three - term recurrence relation X_n = X_(n - 1) + X_(n - 2), n = 1, 2, 3,..., where ϕ is as above and where ψ = (1 - sqrt(5))/2 is the second solution of the equation x^2 - x - 1 = 0, and because { ϕ^(n + 1) } and { ψ^(n + 1) } are C - linearly independent elements, they form a basis of the vector space L, the solution space of the recurrence relation above and a degree 2 vector space over C. Moreover, because the canonical partial numerators { A_n}_(n = 1)^∞, respectively partial denominators { B_n}_(n = 1)^∞, of an arbitrary continued fraction ξ = continued fraction k _ (n=1)^∞ a_n / b_n are also elements of L, it follows that A_n and B_n are C - linear combinations of ϕ^(n + 1) and ψ^(n + 1) for any arbitrary continued fraction ξ = continued fraction k _ (n=1)^∞ a_n / b_n, n = 1, 2, 3,....

Given a hereditary representation of a number n in base b, let B[b](n) be the nonnegative integer which results if we syntactically replace each b by b + 1 (i.e., B[b] is a base change operator that ' bumps the base ' from b up to b + 1).
In other words, every Goodstein sequence converges to 0.
For such ordinals, the base bumping operation leaves the ordinal fixed whereas the subtraction of one decreases the ordinal.

More generally, a bridge is an edge of a not - necessarily - connected graph G whose removal increases the number of components of G. An edge of a connected graph is a bridge iff it does not lie on any cycle.
A bridge is also known as an isthmus, cut - edge, or cut arc.
A connected cubic graph contains a bridge iff it contains an articulation vertex, i.e., if it is not a biconnected graph.

When a group G acts on a set X (this process is called a group action), it permutes the elements of X.
Any particular element X moves around in a fixed path which is called its orbit.
In the notation of set theory, the group orbit of a group element x can be defined as G(x) = { gx element X : g element G }, where g runs over all elements of the group G. For example, for the permutation group G_1 = { (1234), (2134), (1243), (2143) }, the orbits of 1 and 2 are { 1, 2 } and the orbits of 3 and 4 are { 3, 4}.

A lossless data compression algorithm which uses a small number of bits to encode common characters.
Huffman coding approximates the probability for each character as a power of 1/2 to avoid complications associated with using a nonintegral number of bits to encode characters using their actual probabilities.
Huffman coding works on a list of weights {w_i } by building an extended binary tree with minimum weighted external path length and proceeds by finding the two smallest ws, w_1 and w_2, viewed as external nodes, and replacing them with an internal node of weight w_1 + w_2.

Moreover, while it is known that nearly every real number has a regular continued fraction, the geometric mean of whose partial quotients approach K asymptotically, no such x element R has been exhibited ; on the other hand, several significant real numbers have been shown to have regular continued fractions which do not approach K, among which are x = e, x = sqrt(2), x = sqrt(3), and x = ϕ, where ϕ denotes the golden ratio.
The regular continued fraction of K starts out K = [2;1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1,...].
Khinchin's derivation of the above - mentioned result is actually a corollary deduced from the proof of a much stronger result.
From this more general statement, Khinchin's constant can be derived by defining f(r) = lnr, whereby the above equation can be rewritten as lim_(n->∞) (b_1·b_2... 
b_n)^(1/n) = product_(r = 1)^∞ (1 + 1/r(r + 2))^(lnr / ln2), where the infinite product converges to K almost everywhere.

The nth term of a Maclaurin series of a function f can be computed in the Wolfram Language using SeriesCoefficient[f, { x, 0, n }] and is given by the inverse Z - transform a_n = Z^(-1)[1/x](n).
The positions and radii of the Malfatti circles can be found by labeling sides and distances as illustrated above.
The length of the projection of the line connecting circles Γ_1 and Γ_2 onto side AB can be found from the diagram at right to be d_12 | = | sqrt((r_1 + r_2)^2 - (r_2 - r_1)^2)| = | 2sqrt(r_1 r_2).
exp(Λ(n))
In other words, it is a periodic trajectory which comes back to the same point after n iterations of the cycle.
 A general formula giving the number of distinct ways of folding an m×n rectangular map is not known.

A projection which maps a sphere (or spheroid) onto a plane.
Early compilers of classification schemes include Tissot, Close, and Lee.
Then P(x) = R(x) - C(x), and the marginal profit for the x_0th unit is defined by P'(x_0) = R'(x_0) - C'(x_0), where P'(x), R'(x), and C'(x) are the derivatives of P(x), R(x), and C(x), respectively.
A random process whose future probabilities are determined by its most recent values.
< t_n, we have P(x(t_n)<=x_n |x(t_(n - 1)),..., x(t_1)) = P(x(t_n)<=x_n |x(t_(n - 1))).
This is equivalent to P(x(t_n)<=x_n |x(t) for all t<=t_(n - 1)) = P(x(t_n)<=x_n |x(t_(n - 1))).
A sequence of random variates X_0, X_1,....
The term was first used to describe a type of wagering in which the bet is doubled or halved after a loss or win, respectively.
A geometric construction done with a movable compass alone.
Without loss of generality, take AB = 1.
It may have been inspired by moo, a program developed by J. M. Grochow at MIT in the late 1960s.
It is not possible for a matching on a graph with n nodes to exceed n/2 edges.
The five Mathieu groups M_11, M_12, M_22, M_23, and M_24 were the first sporadic groups discovered, having been found in 1861 and 1873 by Mathieu.
Courant and Hilbert use the notation A^ˇ to denote the inverse matrix.
A_︸_n.
The largest value of a set, function, etc.
For example, given the set { 3, 5, 4, 1 }, the sorted version is { 1, 3, 4, 5 }, so the maximum is 5.
A deconvolution algorithm (sometimes abbreviated MEM) which functions by minimizing a smoothness function (" entropy ") in an image.
The back of a clay accounting tablet from Pylos, Greece is illustrated above.
Legend has it that it was the plan for the labyrinth housing the minotaur in the palace at Knossos, Crete, and that it was designed by Daedalus.
It is also said that it was a logo for the city of Troy - or perhaps the plan of some of its walls.
There are several statistical quantities called means, e.g., harmonic mean, geometric mean, arithmetic - geometric mean, and root - mean - square.
When applied to two elements a and b with 0<a<=b, these means satisfy H(a, b)<=G(a, b)<=AGM(a, b)<=A(a, b)<=RMS(a, b).
The following table summarizes these means (again applied to two elements a and b with 0<a<=b), where K(k) is a complete elliptic integral of the first kind.
Then there is at least one point c in (a, b) such that f'(c) = (f(b) - f(a))/(b - a).
It generalizes the intuitive notions of length, area, and volume.
The earliest and most important examples are Jordan measure and Lebesgue measure, but other examples are Borel measure, probability measure, complex measure, and Haar measure.
The triangle ΔM_A M_B M_C formed by joining the midpoints of the sides of a triangle ΔABC.
It is also the cyclocevian triangle of the orthocenter H.
The Wolfram Language function Median[list] can be used to find the statistical median of the elements in a list.
This can be generalized to n - gons P = [V_1,..., V_n], where a transversal cuts the side V_i V_(i + 1) in W_i for i = 1,..., n, by product_(i = 1)^n[(V_i W_i)/(W_i V_(i + 1))] = (-1)^n.
